## Background

Karl met Jun when Jun was a young pirate frequenting shipyards during shore leave. Karl was a talented ship technician who shared Jun's enthusiasm for pushing spacecraft beyond what was sometimes considered legal.

The two spent hours working on Jun's ship, adding modifications that gave tactical advantages in combat:
- Plasma blower to scatter drive plumes and confuse enemy sensors
- Stealth tiling retrofits
- Illegal hydra missiles that split into explosive beads when targeted by point defense

Their illegal tech modifications became popular among other pirates, and the pair turned a tidy profit selling them.

When Jun made his play for independence and stole the advanced drive from [[factions/corporations/alucorp|Alucorp]], Karl joined without hesitation as the ship's engineer.
