# Atruna

The remarkably Earth-like world that attracted the original colonists a millennium ago.

## Planetary Characteristics

- Temperate climate
- Breathable O₂/Ar atmosphere
- Strong magnetic field
- Oceans and continents
- 0.98 g surface gravity
- Wild fauna

## Background

The modern inhabitants of the wider Abecean system are descended from the original colonists of Atruna. After being cut off from Earth, Atruna retained scientific understanding in their databanks, but with a low population and no access to Earth's vast pool of expertise, they had to rebuild engineering and industrial capability from scratch. It took many centuries to match what Earth had before contact was lost.

## Political Status

- Lost position as primary power centuries ago
- Maintains close diplomatic ties with former colonies (Mesulea, Nuilea)
- Considered **neutral ground** for ceremonies and diplomacy
- Mesulean and Nuilean governments integrate Atrunean ceremonial functions

## Notable Locations

### [[atruna/azure-reach|Azure Reach Resort]]

Once the premier diplomatic resort in the system, now a permanent military quarantine zone following a catastrophic bioweapon incident in 12 ABY. 

**Official Story:** An Oziri terrorist attack killed all 5,800 people inside. There were no survivors. The site remains sealed due to environmental contamination.

**The Truth:** A rogue AIA cell developed an incomplete mind-control pathogen that was released by a fanatical operative after the program was shut down. Everyone inside was infected - but they didn't die. They became violently insane while the pathogen dramatically slowed their aging. The ~3,800 survivors remain alive after 140+ years, sustained by secret supply drops while being studied for their **anti-aging properties**.

A secret consortium of elites from across the system - including Mesulean, Nuilean, and even Oziri members - now collaborate on immortality research. National allegiances mean nothing compared to eternal life.

The site represents multiple dark secrets: Atruna's original crime, the cover-up that framed Oziri, and a cross-factional conspiracy of the ultra-wealthy pursuing immortality at any cost.
