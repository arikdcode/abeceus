# Oziri Council

The governing body of [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]], composed of representatives from the most powerful factions (mostly pirate lords and aligned syndicates).

## Oziri's Nature

Oziri's pirate clans are not merely raiders. They function as the **governing class** of a fortified city-world.

Oziri's survival depends on being:
- Profitable enough that outsiders tolerate it
- Orderly enough that commerce keeps flowing
- Dangerous enough that coercion is too costly

## Council Responsibilities

- Docking rights and lane assignment
- Taxation/fees and maintenance obligations
- Policing and neutral-ground enforcement
- Resource stockpile management (food, water, air, industrial consumables)
- Foreign policy (especially during corridor windows)
- Space patrol contributions and defensive readiness

Council decisions are not democratic. They are **negotiated power settlements**.

## Law and Order

Stability is enforced through:
- Reputation and economic incentives
- Selective brutality (high certainty punishment for red lines)
- Private enforcement arms aligned with Council factions

### The Pattern
- Violence tolerated in the "right places"
- Commerce protected in neutral districts and lanes
- Killing on protected ground triggers severe, rapid retaliation

Oziri's order is not moral. It is **functional**.

## The Pirate Compact

After the failed Oziri Conflict, pirate lords formalized restraint:
- Select targets carefully
- Never raid the same corporations too often
- Violators face the wrath of other pirates for bringing danger upon all

## Logistics Reality

To survive, Oziri must secure food, water, air, medical supplies, replacement parts, technicians, and labor through:
- Trade and brokerage (legal and illegal)
- Protection contracts
- Selective raiding
- Internal production

Oziri looks less like a gang hideout and more like a **rough port-state**.
