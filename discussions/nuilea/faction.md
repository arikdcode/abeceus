# Nuilea

Nuilea is a **rising great power** built on scarcity discipline. Where Mesulea inherited a natural helium-3 advantage, Nuilea had to engineer leverage out of worse starting conditions: higher gravity penalties, less convenient helium-3 access, and longer logistical lines.

Nuilea’s state identity is defined by one sentence:

> *“We will not be strangled by someone else’s resource.”*

Nuilean strategy is not “outbuilding” Mesulea in a symmetric race. It is **breaking the terms of dependence** through targeted programs, asymmetry, and political ruthlessness when required.

## Strategic posture

### What Nuilea wants
- Independence from Mesulean helium-3 coercion
- A credible deterrent posture (enough capability to make coercion costly)
- Control over at least one system-level chokepoint: trade, fuel, or infrastructure

### What Nuilea fears
- A future where Mesulea can dictate fleet readiness through fuel markets
- Diplomatic isolation (Atruna as an arbiter + Oziri as a spoiler)
- Being forced into humiliating concessions during corridor windows

## Nuilean doctrine (high-level)

Nuilean doctrine is often summarized internally as **"Industrial Militarism"**:
- industry as a military domain (fuel, power, logistics are weapons)
- security services embedded in major infrastructure
- large programs used as both capability and political theater

Nuilean planners expect conflict to be decided by:
- who sustains operational tempo when markets, comms, and sensors are constrained
- who can deny mobility and refuel cycles
- who can survive political shocks (corridor windows, scandals, leaks)

## Core programs (current era)

Nuilea’s rising-power narrative is carried by a set of program families:

- **[[Mazer Relay Network]]** — beamed-power and control infrastructure to reduce dependence on onboard fuel.
- **[[Project BLUESPIRE]]** — induced atmospheric upwelling events to harvest helium-rich feedstock despite poor natural access.
- **[[Project Janus II]]** — a compartmented long-horizon program marketed as “permanent independence,” with deeper goals.

## Tone and realism guardrails

Nuilea is not a monolithic dystopia.
- Most citizens live ordinary lives inside a stable, functioning state.
- The dark edges exist in **compartmented programs**, security services, and frontier labor regimes.
- Public politics is real: budgets, scandals, veterans, unions, and corporate influence all matter.

Nuilea is modern, competent, and dangerous in believable ways.
