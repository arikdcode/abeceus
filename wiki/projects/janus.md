- Construction of satellites for Abecean orbit
- Leveraging the [[technology/mazer-relay-network|Mazer Relay Network]]

## Strategic Goal

To end Nuilea's dependence on helium-3 by creating alternative energy and fuel infrastructure at scale.

## Deeper Goals

The full scope of Janus II remains classified. It is believed to have objectives beyond what is publicly acknowledged within even Nuilean government circles.

## Secrecy

Were Mesulea to learn the full extent of Janus II, they would likely attempt to counter this threat to their hegemony.
