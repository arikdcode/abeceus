# Atruna

The remarkably Earth-like world that attracted the original colonists a millennium ago.

## Planetary Characteristics

- Temperate climate
- Breathable O₂/Ar atmosphere
- Strong magnetic field
- Oceans and continents
- 0.98 g surface gravity
- Wild fauna

## Background

The modern inhabitants of the wider Abecean system are descended from the original colonists of Atruna. After being cut off from Earth, Atruna retained scientific understanding in their databanks, but with a low population and no access to Earth's vast pool of expertise, they had to rebuild engineering and industrial capability from scratch. It took many centuries to match what Earth had before contact was lost.

## Political Status

- Lost position as primary power centuries ago
- Maintains close diplomatic ties with former colonies (Mesulea, Nuilea)
- Considered **neutral ground** for ceremonies and diplomacy
- Mesulean and Nuilean governments integrate Atrunean ceremonial functions

## Notable Locations

### [[atruna/azure-reach|Azure Reach Resort]]

Once the premier diplomatic resort in the system, now a permanent military quarantine zone following a catastrophic bioweapon incident in 12 ABY.

**Official Story:** An Oziri terrorist attack killed over 4,100 people. The site remains sealed due to environmental contamination.

**The Truth:** A rogue AIA cell developed an incomplete mind-control pathogen that was released by a fanatical operative after the program was shut down. Everyone inside was infected. The infected are still alive after 140+ years, sustained by secret government supply drops while being studied. The Atrunean government fabricated evidence to blame Oziri and has killed numerous people to maintain the cover-up.

The site represents Atruna's darkest secret - a crime against thousands of foreign nationals on neutral ground, hidden by an elaborate conspiracy that has become the foundation of a lie the entire system believes.
