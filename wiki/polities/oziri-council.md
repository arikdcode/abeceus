# Oziri Council

The governing body of [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]], composed of representatives chosen by the most powerful factions on Oziri—mostly pirate lords.

## Nature of Oziri Governance

Oziri's pirate clans are not merely raiders. They function as the **governing class** of a fortified city-world embedded in an alien megastructure.

Oziri's survival depends on being:
- **Profitable enough** that outsiders tolerate it
- **Orderly enough** that commerce keeps flowing
- **Dangerous enough** that coercion is too costly

## Council Responsibilities

The Council oversees policy decisions affecting Oziri as a whole:

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Space patrol** | Each faction contributes military units to patrol Oziri space, protecting from imperial incursions |
| **Docking rights** | Assignment of docks and lanes |
| **Taxation** | Fees and maintenance obligations |
| **Policing** | Neutral-ground enforcement |
| **Resource stockpiles** | Management of food, water, air, industrial consumables |
| **Corporate immunity** | Determining which corporations are protected from raiding |
| **Foreign policy** | Especially critical during [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor windows]] |

## Decision Making

Council decisions are **not democratic**. They are **negotiated power settlements** between factions with competing interests.

## The Pirate Compact

Following the [[setting/oziri-conflict|Oziri Conflict]], the Pirate Lords formalized their approach in a written agreement:

### Core Terms
- Select targets carefully
- Never raid the same corporations too often or too close together
- **If any Pirate Lord or independent pirate becomes too greedy, they face the wrath of the others** for bringing danger upon all

### Neutral Ground Rules
The Compact stipulates restrictions on altercations on **neutral ground**:

**Protected Areas:**
- Commercial districts
- Residential districts
- Administration districts
- Oziri shipping lanes
- Space above commercial docks

**Enforcement:**
- Brawls between warring factions on neutral ground are **generally ignored**
- **Killing on neutral ground earns a death sentence**

This restriction allows parties doing business on Oziri to feel insulated from violence, preventing loss of business for all factions.

## Law and Order

Stability is enforced through a mix of:
- **Reputation and economic incentives**
- **Selective brutality**: High-certainty punishment for certain "red lines"
- **Private enforcement arms** aligned with Council factions

### The Pattern
- Violence is tolerated in the "right places"
- Commerce is protected in designated neutral districts and lanes
- Killing on protected ground triggers severe, rapid retaliation

**Oziri's order is not moral. It is functional.**

## Logistics Reality

To survive, Oziri must secure:
- Food, water, air processing
- Medical supply chains
- Replacement parts and industrial feedstocks
- Technicians and labor

This is achieved through:
- Trade and brokerage (legal and illegal)
- Protection contracts
- Selective raiding that avoids triggering total war
- Internal production in districts capable of manufacturing and recycling

Oziri looks less like a gang hideout and more like a **rough port-state**: markets, labor, security, and bureaucracy, all run by criminals with incentives to keep the machine running.

## Corporate Relationships

The relationships between pirates and corporations are dynamic and complex:

- Some corporations are **targeted by raids**
- Corporations doing business on Oziri are **protected from raiding** by the Council
- Getting **immunity status** can be politically tricky:
  - Some factions may want to do business with a corporation
  - Others may want to raid them
- Most factions are involved in other commerce besides raiding, creating **diverse interests**
- Different interests and schemes are what **lead factions into war with each other**

## Corridor Windows

During [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor windows]], Oziri governance shifts into **"truce mode"**:
- More centralized lane control
- Stricter neutral-ground enforcement
- Aggressive counter-sabotage
- Heavy emphasis on predictable, profitable operations

Outside windows, Oziri reverts to its normal pattern:
- Opportunistic raiding (carefully bounded)
- Factional feuds contained to non-critical zones
- Commerce as the constant glue holding it together

## Reputation and International Relations

### The Azure Reach Shadow

The [[timeline/azure-reach-incident|Azure Reach Incident]] (12 ABY) remains the most significant stain on Oziri's international reputation. The bioweapon outbreak at [[atruna/azure-reach|Azure Reach Resort]] killed over 3,200 people, and forensic analysis suggested the pathogen originated from Oziri research programs.

**Oziri's Official Position:**
- Complete denial of involvement
- Claims evidence was planted to frame them
- Suggests the weapon could have originated from Mesulean or Nuilean black programs
- Points to their cooperation with the investigation as proof of innocence

**International Perception:**
- Most powers believe Oziri was involved, even if accidentally
- The incident validated existing fears about Oziri bioweapon programs
- Led to increased economic sanctions and travel restrictions
- Damaged relationships with neutral trading partners
- Made corporate immunity negotiations more difficult

**Impact on Oziri:**
- Prompted internal Council debates about covert weapons programs
- Some factions pushed to abandon bioweapon research entirely
- Others saw it as proof that better operational security was needed
- Led to purges of intelligence operatives suspected of compromising the operation
- Increased Oziri's reliance on the Freeholds as trading intermediaries

The incident crystallized the system's view of Oziri as inherently dangerous and untrustworthy, regardless of the truth of their involvement. This perception continues to shape diplomatic and economic relations decades later.
