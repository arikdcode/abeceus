# Atrunean Military

The armed forces of [[polities/atruna|Atruna]], the original colony world.

## Status

Militarily significant but not the dominant hegemon compared to the lunar empires.

## Historical Performance

### The Oziri Conflict

*Main article: [[setting/oziri-conflict|The Oziri Conflict]]*

Atrunean marines in power armor participated in the ground assault on [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]]. The campaign was costly:
- The labyrinthine warrens defeated conventional tactics
- Chaotic tunnels and diffractive walls broke up signals
- Endless killboxes inflicted heavy casualties

After tens of thousands of casualties with no end in sight, the battle-weary Atrunean populace pressured their government to concede defeat.
