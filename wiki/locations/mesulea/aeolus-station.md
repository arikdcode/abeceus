# Aeolus Station

The largest and most famous of Mesulea's atmospheric mining ports, stationed near the edge of **Magna Fons** (colloquially "The Fountain")—the largest surface storm on Mesulea.

## Purpose

- Stage helium-3 collection flights
- Buffer and filter helium-rich feedstock
- Provide maintenance and crew rotation facilities
- Coordinate timed ascents to orbital transfer hubs

## Physical Form

- **Buoyancy**: Massive hydrogen lift volumes with rigid internal framing
- **Maneuvering**: Chemical thrusters for station-keeping and storm-edge repositioning
- **Industrial core**: Filtration trains, tank farms, compressors, separation equipment
- **Population**: ~113,000 (mostly rotating shift workers)

The station orbits the storm epicenter, caught in the angular winds of the storm's edge.

## Life on Aeolus

- Brutal shift culture: sleep scheduled around storm windows, not human needs
- Social hierarchy: Pilots (celebrities), Techs (resentful), Admin/Security (state within a state), Service workers (underpaid, indispensable)
- Environment: Loud, vibrating, cramped. Air smells like polymer, disinfectant, and hot metal.

## Hazards

- Sudden turbulence spikes
- Pressure cycling and micro-leaks
- Electrical events (lightning, induced currents)
- Radiation and particle storms

## Rumors

Whispers of anomalous helium signatures, restricted sampling runs below standard safety depths, and quiet programs that treat The Fountain as more than just an industrial resource.
