# Atrunean Intelligence Agency (AIA)

A highly decentralized intelligence organization operating out of [[polities/atruna|Atruna]], with no direct leader. Every operative, digital or human, knows about **at most 1%** of the structure.

## NEXUS

The agency is connected through an anonymous distributed digital network called **NEXUS**.

### Architecture
- NEXUS is hosted by nodes running on hardware across Abecean space
- To prevent attacks, nodes are **not hosted on static hardware**
- Nodes run in secret on civilian hardware until they expire after some time
- NEXUS can regulate its own size, growing or culling nodes as needed
- Nodes are instantiated by **infecting hardware** visible through the Abecean internet with worms
- Each node knows only a **tiny subset** of all nodes, to which they can pass messages
- Nodes can rebroadcast incoming messages to neighbor nodes, causing communications to spread quickly

### Functions
- Runs the software underlying the entire AIA infrastructure
- Relays **work orders** to operatives (from high-level officials or generated by NEXUS itself)
- Tracks the **connectivity** of each operative
- If an operative discovers too much of the agency, NEXUS posts a work order for their **elimination**

### Orphaned Networks
- Since nodes only know of a subset of nodes and nodes expire, a node or group of nodes can become **orphaned** from the wider network
- Orphaned subnetworks often die out, but occasionally grow into **parallel NEXUS networks**
- As nodes migrate around the net, they sometimes encounter an orphaned network and **rejoin**
- Subnetworks can post their own work orders, sometimes leading to **conflicts within the agency**—even civil wars in the intelligence community
- This inefficiency is seen as the acceptable price of secrecy

## Information Bidding

- Operatives can post information they find on NEXUS, stored in a **blockchain distributed database**
- Other operatives or officials can **bid** on NEXUS information
- Upon a successful bid, **cryptocurrency** is deposited into the operative's wallet
- The information is released to the bidder

## Recruitment

There is no formal recruitment process. Operatives can **deputize** non-operatives, making them operatives.

**Consequences:**
- Successful deputies yield the recruiter cryptocurrency
- Overuse of the deputization ability is noted by NEXUS, leading to a **termination order**

**Result:**
AIA operatives can be anyone—military trained operatives, criminals, store clerks, government officials, prostitutes, carpenters, etc.

## Communication & Connectivity

Operatives communicate with known contacts through NEXUS. **Connectivity** is scored in a complex way:

| Factor | Connectivity Value |
|--------|-------------------|
| NEXUS messenger contact | Low, but scales non-linearly (each new person scores more than the last) |
| Physical world contact | Higher than digital-only |
| Anonymous physical meeting | Lower than meeting where contacts know each other well |
| Knowing high-connectivity operatives | Increases your connectivity |

### Balancing
Connectivity is balanced against **utility**. NEXUS scores operative productivity in terms of:
- Posted intel
- Completed work orders
- Facilitation of these through other operatives

Because of productivity, some operatives are allowed more connectivity than others would be permitted.
