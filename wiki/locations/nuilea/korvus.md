# Korvus

The industrial heartland of [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilea]] and one of the two major pillars of the Nuilean system (alongside [[locations/nuilea/varek|Varek]]). All heavy manufacturing is consolidated here.

## Overview

Korvus was not the first moon settled—that was [[locations/nuilea/varek|Varek]]. But as Nuilea industrialized and scaled up, heavy industry **migrated to Korvus** over time. The moon offered better mineral deposits, more space for industrial expansion, and—critically—distance from the capital's population.

Today, Korvus is where Nuilea builds things: ships, weapons, reactors, chemicals, drones. The orbital yards are the system's largest shipbuilding operation by volume. The surface is an endless industrial sprawl.

**Population**: ~450 million

## Why Industry Moved Here

### Mineral Wealth

Korvus has better natural resources than Varek—iron, nickel, aluminum, and other industrial metals in accessible deposits. Local mining supplies much of the raw material for manufacturing, supplemented by imports from [[locations/nuilea/tervok|Tervok]] (rare earths) and [[locations/ludrion/index|Ludrion]] (heavy metals, specialty materials).

### Space and Scale

Industrial expansion on Varek would have meant building over agricultural land and residential areas. Korvus offered room to grow without competing for limited habitable space.

### The Tritium Question

When Nuilea began scaling up **tritium breeding** for domestic fuel independence, there was significant public opposition to co-locating nuclear facilities with the capital's population. Tritium-deuterium fusion produces neutron flux; breeding blankets require careful handling; accidents happen.

The decision to build tritium infrastructure on Korvus rather than Varek was partly technical (more space, better geology) and partly political (NIMBY pressure from Varek residents). This set the precedent: dangerous, dirty, or unpopular industry goes to Korvus.

## Modern Operations

### The Orbital Yards

Massive drydock complexes in orbit where Nuilea's warships are assembled. This is where "dirty fusion" vessels are born—the tritium-reactor workhorses that form the backbone of Nuilean naval power.

- **Scale**: The system's largest shipbuilding operation by volume
- **Products**: Destroyers, frigates, carriers, fleet auxiliaries, mass-produced strike craft
- **Philosophy**: Build rugged, build fast, build in quantity

### Surface Foundries

Industrial complexes processing raw materials into finished components:
- Hull plating and structural members
- Pressure vessels and reactor housings
- Armor panels and radiation shielding
- Standardized modules and fittings

### Tritium Breeding Facilities

The heart of Nuilean fuel independence. Lithium blanket reactors synthesize tritium domestically, reducing dependence on Mesulean helium-3.

D-T fusion is "dirtier" than aneutronic He-3 reactions—more neutron flux, more radiation, more shielding required. But it's *available*. Korvus accepts the tradeoffs because [[locations/nuilea/varek|Varek]] wouldn't.

### Munitions Complex

Where the system's arsenal is manufactured:
- Ship-to-ship missiles and torpedoes
- Point defense systems
- Drone swarms and autonomous weapons
- Explosives for mining and military use
- "Civilian-spec" export weapons

### Mining Operations

Korvus has its own extensive mining operations, but they don't cover everything:
- **Local mining**: Iron, nickel, aluminum, common industrial metals
- **From [[locations/nuilea/tervok|Tervok]]**: Rare earth elements
- **From [[locations/ludrion/index|Ludrion]]**: Heavy metals, specialty alloys, materials Korvus lacks

### Chemical Production

Industrial chemicals at scale: propellants, polymers, catalysts, fertilizers, explosives. The chemical sector supports both manufacturing and agriculture across the Nuilean system.

## Character

Korvus is a world of constant industry. The sky glows with orbital construction lights. The ground rumbles with foundry operations. Workers live in dense housing blocks adjacent to their factories.

There is no cultural district, no entertainment quarter beyond worker bars and company recreation facilities. The moon exists to build things. Everything else is secondary.

## Labor

Korvus runs on industrial labor. Unions exist but are constrained in strategic sectors—strikes in shipyards or tritium plants are effectively illegal. Workers are well-compensated by Nuilean standards, but conditions are harsh and safety regulations are flexible.

The dark edge of Nuilean labor practices is visible here: long shifts, exposure risks, industrial accidents that get quietly settled. Most citizens accept this as the price of independence.
