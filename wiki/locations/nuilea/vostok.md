# Vostok

A strategically positioned moon in the outer reaches of the [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilean]] system. Military installations, early warning systems, and a major [[technology/mazer-relay-network|Mazer Relay Network]] node.

## Overview

Vostok's orbit is **much farther out** than the other major Nuilean moons—a deliberate choice that maximizes its value as an early warning station and defensive perimeter. Anything approaching the Nuilean system from the outer reaches passes Vostok's sensors first.

**Population**: ~3 million (mostly military personnel and dependents)

## Military Function

### Early Warning

Sensor arrays on Vostok monitor approaches to the Nuilean system. Long-range detection gives strategic command time to respond to incoming threats—whether military, commercial, or diplomatic.

### Fleet Staging

Vostok hosts repair facilities, supply depots, and crew rotation infrastructure for naval operations. Ships transiting through Nuilean space often stop here for resupply.

### Customs & Quarantine

All incoming traffic to the Nuilean system passes through Vostok checkpoints. Cargo is inspected, crews are documented, and suspicious vessels are detained for investigation.

## Mazer Relay Network Node

Vostok hosts a major MRN relay station—one of the classified nodes that make up Nuilea's beamed power infrastructure. The station's exact capabilities are secret, but it's known to support both power transmission and communication relay functions.

Security around the MRN facility is extreme. Unauthorized approach is met with lethal force.

## Character

A military moon. Uniforms everywhere, checkpoints at every transition, restricted zones covering most of the surface. Civilian dependents live in designated residential areas with limited freedom of movement.

Vostok is not a punishment posting—it's a prestigious assignment for career military—but it's not comfortable either. The atmosphere is disciplined, serious, constantly aware of potential threats.

## Strategic Significance

Vostok is the "front door" of the Nuilean system. Anyone approaching knows they're being watched. This deters casual provocation and provides warning for serious threats.
