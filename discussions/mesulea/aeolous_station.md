# Aeolus Station

**Aeolus Station** is the largest and most famous of Mesulea’s atmospheric mining ports, stationed near the edge of the vast storm system known officially as **Magna Fons** and colloquially as **The Fountain**.

It is both:
- a working industrial platform full of tired labor and strict schedules, and
- a spectacle: a city in the sky, orbiting a storm wall like a ship tacking along a cliff.

---

## Purpose

Aeolus exists to:
- stage collection flights,
- buffer and filter helium-rich feedstock,
- provide maintenance and crew rotation facilities,
- and coordinate timed ascents to orbital transfer hubs.

It is designed around throughput and uptime, not comfort.

## Physical form (high level)

- **Buoyancy structure:** massive lift volumes (hydrogen/other lifting media) with rigid internal framing
- **Maneuvering:** thrusters for station-keeping, drift correction, and storm-edge repositioning
- **Industrial core:** filtration trains, tank farms, compressors, and separation equipment
- **Habitat ring(s):** rotating or semi-rotating modules are possible, but Mesulea often accepts reduced comfort in exchange for mass efficiency
- **Docking:** external hardpoints for aircraft, service craft, and limited cargo shuttles

The station is built to flex. It is assumed to be struck by turbulence events that would destroy conventional orbital habitats.

## Life on Aeolus

### Workforce cadence
- Most personnel work in rotations measured in weeks (or months) on-station, then cycle off.
- Shift culture is brutal: sleep is scheduled around storm windows, not human needs.

### Social stratification
- **Pilots** are celebrities and liabilities.
- **Techs** keep the station alive and resent everyone.
- **Admin/security** act like a state within a state.
- **Service workers** (food, sanitation, medical) are underpaid and indispensable.

### The station’s mood
Aeolus is loud, vibrating, cramped, and chemically clean in all the wrong places.
- Air smells like polymer, disinfectant, and hot metal.
- Every corridor has emergency signage for pressure loss, toxic exposure, and “storm surge conditions.”

---

## Hazards (routine, not exceptional)

- sudden turbulence spikes that throw unsecured bodies into bulkheads
- pressure cycling and micro-leaks that become chronic maintenance battles
- electrical events: lightning and induced currents that force intermittent blackout protocols
- radiation and particle storms requiring comms/sensor “quiet” periods

## Aeolus as a stage for secrets (worldbuilding only)

Aeolus is a natural cover for anything that needs:
- isolation,
- plausible deniability (“storm damage” explains many anomalies),
- and restricted access.

One persistent rumor class (unconfirmed):
- **anomalous helium signatures** that behave “too well” compared to expected isotopic performance
- whispers of restricted sampling runs below standard safety depth
- a quiet program that treats The Fountain as more than an industrial resource
