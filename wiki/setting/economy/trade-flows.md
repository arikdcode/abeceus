## Major Trade Routes

### The Fuel Arteries (Mesulea → Everyone)

**What flows**: Helium-3 (raw and refined), reactor components, fuel contracts

**Route characteristics**:
- High-value, high-security cargo
- Convoyed tankers and container ships
- Insurance requirements strict
- Delivery schedules are political instruments

**Destinations**:
| Destination | Volume | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Atruna | High | Civilian, commercial, military |
| Nuilea | High | **Strategic dependency**—source of leverage |
| Freeholds | Medium | Essential but smaller total volume |
| Oziri | Low/Gray | Intermediaries, captured cargo, immunity corps |

---

### The Metal Road (Freeholds → Inner System)

**What flows**: Bulk metals, platinum group metals, rare earths, volatiles

**Route characteristics**:
- Bulk carriers, less security than fuel
- Relatively safe (pirates prefer richer targets)
- Price-sensitive commodity trade
- Multiple Freehold sources create competition

**Destinations**:
| Destination | Primary Goods | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Nuilea | Nickel-iron, rare earths | Manufacturing feedstock |
| Mesulea | Platinum group, specialty metals | Orbital yards |
| Atruna | Specialty metals, volatiles | Precision manufacturing |
| Oziri | Various (via intermediaries) | Gray market routing |

---

### The Arsenal Express (Nuilea → Everywhere)

**What flows**: Ship modules, tritium ships, munitions, industrial chemicals

**Route characteristics**:
- Standardized cargo, container shipping
- "Civilian-spec" designations for weapons
- Goes everywhere, including through cutouts to Oziri
- Volume-based pricing

**Destinations**:
| Destination | Primary Goods | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Mesulea | Munitions, military modules | Quiet purchases |
| Atruna | Mass-manufactured goods | Cost efficiency |
| Freeholds | Weapons, chemicals, ships | Defense and industry |
| Oziri | Everything (through cutouts) | "Sells to anyone with currency" |

---

### The Certification Circuit (Atruna → Everywhere)

**What flows**: Insurance, registry services, financial products, high-end components

**Route characteristics**:
- Not primarily physical cargo
- Atrunean paper travels with every shipment
- High-end components on others' hulls
- Service revenue, not commodity revenue

**Destinations**:
| Destination | Primary Services | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Mesulea | Insurance, electronics, optics | Complementary trade |
| Nuilea | Insurance, electronics, finance | Necessary commerce |
| Freeholds | Financial services, certification | Institutional support |
| Oziri | Very limited | Atrunean insurance avoids Oziri routes |

---

### The Gray Network (Oziri ↔ Everyone)

**What flows**: Strike craft, salvage, gray/black goods, deniable services

**Route characteristics**:
- Indirect routing through Freeholds
- Immunity-deal corporations
- "Off the books" even when technically legal
- High margins, high risk

**Key flows**:
| Direction | Goods/Services | Via |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Oziri → out | Strike craft, avionics, salvage, information | Freehold intermediaries |
| In → Oziri | Food, tooling, chemicals, fuel | Immunity corps, Freeholds |

---

## Bilateral Trade Summary

### Mesulea ↔ Atruna
| Mesulea exports | Atruna exports |
|-----------------|----------------|
| He-3 fuel | Precision electronics |
| Reactor components | High-end optics |
| Large ships | Financial services |
| Storm-tech equipment | Insurance products |
| | Cultural goods |
| | Certification services |

**Character**: Respectful rivalry. Mesulea has resources; Atruna has institutions. Each needs what the other has.

---

### Mesulea ↔ Nuilea
| Mesulea exports | Nuilea exports |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **He-3 fuel** (critical) | Munitions (quietly) |
| Some reactor parts | Military modules |
| | Industrial chemicals |

**Character**: Tense dependency. Nuilea needs Mesulean fuel; Mesulea uses this as leverage. Both sides maintain the relationship carefully—Nuilea can't be pushed too hard without risking desperation.

---

### Mesulea ↔ Freeholds
| Mesulea exports | Freehold exports |
|-----------------|------------------|
| He-3 fuel | Rare metals |
| Manufactured goods | Platinum group |
| Some food | Volatiles |
| | Raw materials |

**Character**: Transactional. Mesulea needs feedstock; Freeholds need fuel and finished goods. Neither threatens the other.

---

### Nuilea ↔ Atruna
| Nuilea exports | Atruna exports |
|----------------|----------------|
| Mass-manufactured goods | Precision electronics |
| Some weapons | High-end sensors |
| Industrial chemicals | Financial services |
| Tritium ships | Luxury goods |
| | Insurance |

**Character**: Necessary commerce. Nuilea needs Atrunean components and institutional access. Atruna needs Nuilean volume manufacturing. Trade is substantial despite political coolness.

---

### Nuilea ↔ Freeholds
| Nuilea exports | Freehold exports |
|----------------|------------------|
| Manufactured goods | Rare metals |
| Weapons | Volatiles |
| Chemicals | Raw materials |
| Tritium ships | |

**Character**: Important supplier. Nuilean factories need Freehold raw materials. Freeholds need Nuilean manufactured goods and weapons for defense.

---

### Atruna ↔ Freeholds
| Atruna exports | Freehold exports |
|----------------|------------------|
| Food | Bulk metals |
| Financial services | Volatiles |
| Consumer goods | Some specialty ores |
| Certification | Transshipment services |

**Character**: Complementary. Atruna provides what Freeholds can't make; Freeholds provide what Atruna doesn't have. Clean, mutually beneficial.

---

### Oziri ↔ Freeholds
| Oziri exports | Freehold exports |
|---------------|------------------|
| Strike craft | Food |
| Salvage materials | Raw materials |
| Gray-market goods | Manufacturing inputs |
| Services | Transshipment |

**Character**: Essential intermediary. Freeholds are Oziri's primary link to the inner system. Many goods flow through Freehold stations to obscure origin/destination.

---

### Oziri ↔ Inner System (Gray Channels)

Oziri trades with Mesulea, Nuilea, and Atruna, but **not officially**:

| Via | What flows to Oziri | What flows from Oziri |
|-----|---------------------|----------------------|
| Immunity corporations | Food, fuel, goods | Protection fees, market access |
| Freehold transshipment | Everything | Everything |
| Captured cargo | Random | N/A |
| Gray-market intermediaries | Specialized goods | Strike craft, salvage |

**Character**: Everyone knows it happens. No one admits it officially. Essential for Oziri survival; useful for inner system actors who need deniability.

---

### Hespers ↔ Abeceus System

**During corridor windows only.**

| Hespers import | Hespers export |
|----------------|----------------|
| He-3 (premium prices) | Unknown goods |
| Specialty goods | Technology hints |
| Biologicals | Hard currency |
| Materials | Information |

**Primary trading partners**:
- **Oziri**: First stop, eager to trade, few questions
- **Mesulea**: He-3 supplier
- **Freeholds**: Opportunistic

**Character**: Economically explosive. Corridor windows are gold rush events. Hesper willingness to pay premium prices reshapes markets temporarily.

---

## Trade Infrastructure

### Convoy Economics

Interplanetary shipping is not "send a ship and hope":

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Escort allocation | Navies and private security; limited supply forces convoy formation |
| Insurance requirements | Underwriters demand escorts for certain routes/cargoes |
| Storm/flare windows | Abecean flares create sensor blackouts; timing matters |
| Transfer windows | Optimal orbital mechanics cluster departures |

**Result**: Trade moves in **pulses**, not continuous flow. Disrupting a convoy window is more damaging than destroying a single ship.

### Insurance & Risk

Atrunean underwriters dominate ship insurance because:
- Deep capital reserves
- Reputation for paying claims
- Accepted by all major ports

**Rate factors**:
| Factor | Impact on rates |
|--------|-----------------|
| He-3 vs. tritium ship | He-3 significantly cheaper |
| Inner system vs. outer | Outer routes much higher |
| Convoyed vs. independent | Independent much higher |
| Atrunean registry vs. other | Atrunean cheaper |
| Cargo type | Weapons, passengers higher |

**Insurance as leverage**: Atruna can effectively blockade a route by making it uninsurable.

### Currency & Settlement

No single system-wide currency:

| Currency | Acceptance | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Atrunean Standard Credit (ASC) | Universal | Default for contracts, insurance |
| Mesulean Energy Unit (MEU) | Fuel trade | Pegged to He-3 prices |
| Freehold Scrip | Local | Quality varies by issuer |
| Oziri | None official | ASC, MEU, barter, crypto |

---

## Trade Tensions & Chokepoints

### The He-3 Chokepoint
- All He-3 flows from Mesulea
- Contract terms are political weapons
- Nuilea constantly seeks alternatives
- Corridor windows briefly change the math (Hespers buy at premium)

### The Certification Barrier
- Atrunean standards determine market access
- Competing standards exist but lack universality
- New technology needs Atrunean blessing for wide adoption

### The Food Leverage
- Oziri cannot feed itself
- Freeholds are food-deficit
- Food exporters (Atruna, Mesulea) have leverage
- Strategic stockpiles provide buffer, not solution

### The Insurance Gate
- Atrunean underwriters can effectively blockade routes
- "Uninsurable" cargo or routes face severe practical barriers
- Leverage is real but must be used carefully

---

## Sanctions & Evasion

### How Sanctions Work
- Atruna can refuse insurance, registry, arbitration
- Mesulea can refuse fuel contracts
- Both can pressure Freeholds to refuse transshipment

### How Evasion Works
- Freehold registry and routing
- Reflagging ships
- Relabeling cargo
- Intermediary corporations
- Oziri as endpoint

### The Gray Zone
- Much trade exists in ambiguous legal status
- "Civilian-spec" weapons
- Transshipped goods with unclear origin
- Immunity-deal corporations trading with Oziri

---

## Seasonal & Cyclical Patterns

### Corridor Windows
- Hesper arrival reshapes trade patterns
- Premium prices for He-3 and specialty goods
- Oziri becomes temporarily central
- Duration: weeks to months

### Abecean Flares
- Frequent, unpredictable
- Communications/sensor blackouts
- Pirates exploit windows
- Convoys time around known flare cycles

### Political Cycles
- Mesulean elections affect fuel contract terms
- Nuilean program announcements affect weapons demand
- Atrunean regulatory changes affect insurance costs
