# Nuilea

The second gas giant in the Abeceus system. A **rising great power** built on scarcity discipline.

## Planetary Characteristics

- Jovian mass: 1.16
- Jovian radius: 0.87
- Denser but smaller than Mesulea
- **Nearly double Mesulea's surface gravity** — makes atmospheric operations extremely difficult
- 87 moons

## Background

Major colonization began ~50 years after Mesulea, with fewer resources devoted to the effort. Nuilea's greater distance, lack of accessible helium-3, and Mesulea's head start left it in a subordinate position for centuries.

## The Scarcity Identity

Nuilean state identity is defined by one sentence:

> *"We will not be strangled by someone else's resource."*

Nuilean strategy is not about outbuilding Mesulea symmetrically. It's about **breaking the terms of dependence** through targeted programs, asymmetry, and political ruthlessness.

## Helium-3 Dependence

To mitigate Mesulean market dominance, Nuilea:
- Built a small domestic helium-3 industry through extreme measures
- Uses **enslaved prisoners** on mining platforms (forcibly equipped with gravity-survival implants)
- Imposes tariffs on foreign helium-3
- Still cannot meet local demand—giving Mesulea economic leverage
