# Abeceus

The unary star of the Abecean System. Similar to Earth's Sun in spectral band and luminosity, but somewhat smaller and less massive.

## Significance

- Primary energy source for the entire system
- Target of Nuilea's [[projects/janus|Janus II Project]] (Dyson Swarm)
- Abecean flares are frequent, emitting large bursts of x-rays that force spacecraft to shield sensitive equipment—creating windows exploited by pirates
