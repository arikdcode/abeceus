# Tiān Cylinder

An O'Neill cylinder in the [[locations/clusters/index|Belt Cluster]], constructed by the spacer union *Hànzú Láodòng zhě* ("Workers of the Han").

## Culture

The cylinder was founded by a community of Chinese colonists to [[locations/atruna/index|Atruna]]. Its culture would be recognizable as Chinese to 21st century humans, but has evolved and incorporated other ideas:
- Chinese architecture, artistic themes, language, and diet have persisted
- Some social conventions have changed

## Governance

The spacer union is run by three prominent families.

## Notable People

- [[characters/hai-jun|Hai Jun]] was born here before leaving for [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilea]]
