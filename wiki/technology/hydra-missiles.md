# Hydra Missiles

Illegal missile systems that split their payload when targeted by point defense weapons.

## Mechanism

Just before being struck by a point defense weapon, hydra missiles blow apart, splitting their payload into a multitude of smaller explosive beads. This confuses point defense systems by overwhelming them with multiple targets.

## History

[[characters/karl-schneider|Karl Schneider]] installed illegal hydra missiles on [[characters/hai-jun|Hai Jun's]] fighter during their early pirate days. The technology became widely adopted by the [[factions/pirate-clans/spike-reavers|Spike Reavers]] and contributed to their fearsome reputation.

## Effectiveness

During the [[locations/clusters/alucorp-station|Alucorp Station]] raid, a swarm of hydra missile fragments traveling at a sizable fraction of light speed vaporized two Atrunean cruisers before their point defense systems could react.
