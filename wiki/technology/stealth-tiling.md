# Stealth Tiling

Hull modifications that reduce a spacecraft's sensor signature.

## Description

Stealth tiling is a hull retrofit that makes spacecraft harder to detect on enemy sensors. Combined with other modifications like plasma blowers (which scatter drive plumes over large angles), stealth-tiled ships can significantly reduce their detectability.

## History

[[characters/karl-schneider|Karl Schneider]] retrofitted [[characters/hai-jun|Hai Jun's]] fighter with stealth tiling at great expense. The jet black stealth fighters of the [[factions/pirate-clans/spike-reavers|Spike Reavers]] became known and feared among trading barges.
