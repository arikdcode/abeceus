# Sume

The largest of [[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulea's]] 113 moons and the agricultural breadbasket of the [[polities/mesulea|Mesulean Lunar Empire]].

## Characteristics

Sume is the only Mesulean moon with a breathable atmosphere. The atmosphere was artificially created to sustain surface agriculture, engineered with sufficient greenhouse gases to maintain a stable human-suitable temperature.

## Economy

The entire surface is covered in farms, providing the majority of sustenance for the MLE as well as exports to [[locations/atruna/index|Atruna]] and [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilea]].
