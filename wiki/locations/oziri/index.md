# Oziri

The outermost planet, transformed by an ancient alien civilization into a **planetary megafortress**. Now home to a sprawling pirate nation-state.

## The Shell

100–300 meters below Oziri's dark, frozen surface lies a **planetary shell**:
- 300 meters thick
- Multiple layers of previously unknown super-alloys, perfect down to the last atom
- Colossal metal supports connect distant sections
- Complex carbon networks weave through the structure, providing flexibility

The shell could withstand concentrated direct hits from the entire Mesulean arsenal. Tunnel networks branch off in fractal patterns, flexing gracefully in response to bombardment.

## The Builders

The shell was constructed by the **[[species/vey|Vey]]**—a long-vanished alien civilization. No sign of their technology beyond the civil engineering has been found. No sign of why they abandoned Oziri either.

## Why Pirates Took It

- Lacks critical resources for self-sufficient industry
- Remote location made it unattractive for government colonization
- **Uniquely defensible** but too far from anything valuable for military use
- When wealthy pirates acquired advanced drives, they retreated here
- The labyrinthine warrens proved impossible to root them out of

## The Oziri Conflict

Mesulea and Atruna attempted a massive ground assault. It failed catastrophically—the defenders knew the tunnels, the attackers walked in blind. After tens of thousands of casualties, Atruna withdrew, and Mesulea's blockade collapsed under attrition.

## Modern Oziri

Today, Oziri is a functioning criminal nation-state:
- Ruled by pirate lords, corporate representatives, and local mafias
- Crime exists but is controlled—the powers dislike competitors
- You can get anything and find out anything here
- Tremendous opportunity for those with wits and flexible morals
