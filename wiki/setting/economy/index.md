## The Five Economies

| Power | Character | Core Advantage |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| [[setting/economy/mesulea-economy|Mesulea]] | Energy hegemon | He-3 monopoly, cheap energy enables everything |
| [[setting/economy/nuilea-economy|Nuilea]] | Industrial arsenal | Volume manufacturing, accepts ugly tradeoffs |
| [[setting/economy/atruna-economy|Atruna]] | Services & standards | Institutions everyone needs but can't replicate |
| [[setting/economy/freeholds-economy|Freeholds]] | Resource frontier | Raw materials, flexibility, escape valves |
| [[setting/economy/oziri-economy|Oziri]] | Shadow market | Strike craft, salvage, deniability |

## Key Concepts

### The Reactor Divide

| Reactor Type | Fuel | Advantages | Disadvantages | Leader |
|--------------|------|------------|---------------|--------|
| He-3 Fusion | Mesulea | Clean, efficient, good insurance | Fuel dependency | Mesulea |
| D-T (Tritium) | Nuilea/Freeholds | Cheap, available | Neutron activation, penalties | Nuilea |

### The Certification Regime

Atrunean institutions dominate system-wide standards:
- Ship registries (Atrunean = accepted everywhere)
- Reactor certification ("Atrunean Standard" is baseline)
- Insurance (Atrunean underwriters set rates)
- Arbitration (contracts default to Atrunean courts)

### Economic Chokepoints

| Chokepoint | Controller | Leverage |
|------------|------------|----------|
| He-3 supply | Mesulea | Fuel contract terms as political weapons |
| Certification | Atruna | Standards determine market access |
| Insurance | Atruna | Can make routes uninsurable |
| Raw materials | Freeholds | Control feedstock for manufacturing |
| Food (to Oziri) | Various | Oziri's critical vulnerability |

## Quick Trade Matrix

Who exports what to whom:

| From ↓ / To → | Mesulea | Nuilea | Atruna | Freeholds | Oziri |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Mesulea** | — | He-3 ★★★ | He-3, ships | He-3, goods | (gray) |
| **Nuilea** | Munitions | — | Mfg goods | Weapons | (cutouts) |
| **Atruna** | Electronics | Electronics | — | Services | (limited) |
| **Freeholds** | Metals | Metals | Metals | — | Materials |
| **Oziri** | (gray) | (gray) | (minimal) | Strike craft | — |

★★★ = Critical dependency
