# Cognition Augmentation Devices (CADs)

Brain-computer interfaces that enhance cognitive ability.

## Components

A CAD's core engine consists of three technologies:

1. **Mind Machine Interface (MMI)** — Hardware attached to the brain with read/write capabilities and low-level routing software

2. **Biologically Compatible Microchip (BCM)** — The substrate the CMI runs on

3. **Cognitive Modeling Intelligence (CMI)** — An AI that monitors and interprets brain activity, providing an API for software to interact with the mind

## Capabilities

Through a CAD, standard software can interface with the brain:
- The CMI interprets requests from the brain and runs handling software
- Software can send commands to the CMI, which figures out how to convey output to the mind

## History

### First Development (600 years ago)

The first team to build a working CAD was far ahead of competitors due to key CMI discoveries. Three team members secretly implanted CADs in themselves—and immediately tried to kill each other. The survivor was **Alexei Zhakharov**.

### Government Response

The Atrunean government banned CAD production but secretly hired the remaining team to continue development.

### Alexei's Madness

In hiding, Alexei continued experimenting on his own CAD:
- Boosted cognitive ability but became emotionally unstable
- His brain became addicted to enhancement
- Underwent extreme behavioral phases (violence, hypersexuality, depression)
- Eventually his enhanced cognition allowed him to stabilize his emotional state
