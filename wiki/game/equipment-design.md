# Equipment Design Document

Equipment is a core pillar of character customization—easy to swap for different situations, expressive of playstyle, and deeply tied to the setting's factions and corporations.

## Design Philosophy

### Equipment as Character Expression

A character's loadout tells a story. The merc carrying a beat-up Hammerstar rifle with aftermarket optics is different from the operator with a pristine Angelico energy carbine. Equipment choices reflect:

- **Economic status** (can you afford the good stuff?)
- **Faction alignment** (who do you buy from? who trusts you?)
- **Tactical philosophy** (overwhelming firepower vs. surgical precision)
- **Experience** (veterans know what works; rookies follow trends)

### Manufacturer Identity

Every piece of equipment comes from somewhere. Major manufacturers have **recognizable design language**—visual, auditory, and functional signatures that experienced characters can identify.

**Design Goals:**
- Players learn to recognize equipment by sight and sound
- Each manufacturer has strengths, weaknesses, and a market niche
- Manufacturer choice creates meaningful tradeoffs, not just stat variations
- Lore and gameplay reinforce each other

**In-Game Recognition:**
- A veteran hears a distinctive crack and knows: *"Hammerstar railgun—stay in cover."*
- A smuggler sees the sleek white casing and knows: *"Angelico gear—this buyer has money."*
- A mechanic notices the modular housing and knows: *"Sabine Industries—I can fix this with standard parts."*

### Meaningful Tradeoffs

Equipment should present **real choices**, not obvious upgrades:

| Tradeoff | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Power vs. Reliability | High-performance weapons jam more often |
| Capability vs. Cost | Elite gear is expensive to buy AND maintain |
| Specialization vs. Versatility | Best-in-class for one thing, mediocre at everything else |
| Stealth vs. Firepower | Suppressed weapons deal less damage |
| Weight vs. Protection | Heavy armor protects but slows you down |
| Complexity vs. Repairability | Advanced tech requires specialists to fix |

### Availability & Faction Access

Not everything is available everywhere:

- **Mesulean military gear** is restricted; getting it is a statement
- **Oziri black-market weapons** are available but legally risky
- **Atrunean corporate equipment** requires licenses or connections
- **Freehold salvage** is cheap but inconsistent quality
- **Pirate clan gear** is often stolen, modified, or improvised

## Manufacturers

For detailed profiles of all manufacturers and corporations, see: **[[game/manufacturers|Manufacturers & Corporations]]**

Equipment comes from recognizable sources. Major manufacturers have distinct design languages—visual, auditory, and functional signatures. A few examples:

| Manufacturer | Alignment | Niche | Character |
|--------------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Hammerstar** | Nuilea | Military kinetics | Brutal, reliable |
| **Angelico** | Atruna | Energy weapons | Elegant, expensive |
| **Sabine** | Freeholds | Modular gear | Practical, repairable |
| **VTC** | Mesulea | Stealth/infiltration | Covert, restricted |
| **Picard** | Atruna | Cybernetics | Cutting-edge, invasive |
| **Oziri Clans** | Oziri | Custom work | Bespoke, variable |

The full manufacturers document covers 40+ corporations across defense, aerospace, electronics, medical, industrial, and consumer sectors.

## Equipment Categories

### Weapons

#### Kinetic Weapons

Traditional projectile weapons using chemical propellants or electromagnetic acceleration.

| Type | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Sidearms | Backup, concealed carry | Pistols, revolvers, machine pistols |
| SMGs | Close quarters, high rate of fire | Compact, controllable |
| Carbines | Versatile primary weapon | Shorter range than rifles |
| Rifles | Standard infantry weapon | Effective at medium-long range |
| Precision Rifles | Long-range engagement | Sniper rifles, DMRs |
| Shotguns | Close range, breaching | Devastating up close |
| Support Weapons | Suppression, squad support | LMGs, heavy repeaters |
| Anti-Materiel | Vehicles, emplacements | Heavy sniper rifles, railguns |
| Launchers | Explosives delivery | Grenade launchers, rocket launchers |
| Shipboard | Point defense, boarding repulsion | Mounted weapons |

**Ammunition Considerations:**
- Standard rounds (readily available)
- Armor-piercing (restricted, expensive)
- Hollow-point (anti-personnel, banned for military use)
- Subsonic (for suppressed weapons)
- Exotic (explosive, incendiary, EMP)

#### Energy Weapons

Directed-energy weapons using laser, plasma, or particle beams.

| Type | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Laser Weapons | Precision, armor penetration | Near-instant hit, affected by atmosphere |
| Plasma Weapons | High damage, area effect | Short range, slow projectile |
| Particle Beams | Extreme penetration | Heavy, power-hungry |
| Stunners | Non-lethal incapacitation | Law enforcement, capture operations |

**Energy Weapon Tradeoffs:**
- Excellent armor penetration against kinetic armor
- Reduced effectiveness against energy-dispersing shields
- Dependent on power cells (heavy, expensive)
- Affected by environmental conditions (smoke, rain)
- Heat buildup limits sustained fire

#### Melee Weapons

Close-quarters weapons for silent kills, boarding actions, or desperate situations.

| Type | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Knives | Utility, silent kills | Every operator carries one |
| Batons | Non-lethal, riot control | Extendable, concealable |
| Axes/Hatchets | Breaching, boarding tradition | Favored by Oziri clans |
| Swords/Machetes | Status symbol, boarding | Impractical but intimidating |
| Powered Blades | Armor penetration | Vibro-blades, monomolecular edges |
| Shock Weapons | Non-lethal, pain compliance | Stun batons, shock gloves |

#### Explosives & Ordnance

Area-denial, breaching, and demolition tools.

| Type | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Fragmentation Grenades | Anti-personnel | Standard infantry issue |
| Concussion Grenades | Stun, breach support | Non-lethal(ish) |
| Smoke Grenades | Concealment, signaling | Thermal and visual variants |
| Flashbangs | Entry, disorientation | Temporary blind/deaf |
| EMP Grenades | Electronics disruption | Disables tech, expensive |
| Breaching Charges | Door/wall destruction | Controlled demolition |
| Mines | Area denial, ambush | Pressure, tripwire, or remote |
| Missiles/Rockets | Anti-vehicle, anti-structure | Heavy ordnance |

### Armor & Protection

#### Body Armor

Personal protection against various threats.

| Type | Protection | Mobility | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| Soft Armor | Light kinetic, blades | Full | Concealable, comfortable |
| Tactical Vest | Moderate kinetic | High | Standard operator kit |
| Plate Carrier | High kinetic | Moderate | Military standard, heavy |
| Powered Armor | Maximum | Low-Moderate | Powered assist, expensive |
| Stealth Suit | Minimal | Full | Thermal masking, sensor dampening |

**Armor Degradation:**
- Plates crack and must be replaced after hits
- Soft armor loses effectiveness over time
- Damage is visible (players can assess enemy condition)

#### Helmets

Head protection with optional integrated systems.

| Type | Features | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Bump Helmet | Impact only | Lightweight, mount points |
| Ballistic Helmet | Projectile protection | Standard military |
| Full-Face | Complete coverage, sealed | HUD integration, comms |
| Powered Helmet | Enhanced sensors, computing | Part of powered armor |

#### Shields

Active or passive protection systems.

| Type | Mechanism | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Ballistic Shield | Physical barrier | Carried, heavy, full coverage |
| Deployable Cover | Expanding barrier | Sets up quickly, stationary |
| Energy Shield | Deflector field | Drains power, blocks energy/kinetic |
| Personal Shield | Body-worn field | Emergency protection, limited use |

**Shield Tradeoffs:**
- Energy shields block both kinetic and energy but drain power
- Energy-dispersing shields counter energy weapons but not kinetic
- Physical barriers provide reliable cover but limit mobility
