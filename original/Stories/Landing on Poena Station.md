## Poena Station

The gentle silence of freefall was shattered by the infernal roar of the shuttle's engines. Arman felt his body slam into his seat while the straps holding him down bit into his chest. He closed his eyes and fruitlessly tried to ignore the engines, which howled at him like demons. Fitting, he thought, considering where he was going.

As the shuttle began to slow, and the mounting gravity was becoming unbearable, there was a loud clunk and the shuttle shook as it made contact with the landing pad. The engines finally sputtered out and Arman was able to hear the groaning and muttering of his fellow passengers with his ringing ears. He looked around, but saw no one he recognized. They were all dressed in the same plain gray uniforms and bore similar grim expressions. Some whinged about their ears or the gravity, a few seemed to struggle to stay upright in their seats.

After a few moments, there was a hiss, and a door at the end of the crew compartment opened. A man in powered armor hefting a mag rifle, entered. A crackling came from the armors com speaker, “Up, and out the door at the end, single-file\! Inner seats, then middle, then outer.”

Arman undid his seat buckles and hesitantly rose to his feet. The sensation of 3.5 g was even more uncomfortable than he imagined, but the freshly installed skeletal supports seemed to do a reasonable job holding him up. The artificial heart pumps did little to dissuade his heart from racing however.

Arman followed the man in front of him towards the door. Each footstep was a process. He focused intently on lifting his legs and placing his feet, fearing his body could topple at any moment. Miraculously, he managed to make it to the door with no accidents. He entered a dimly lit tunnel that was mated to the shuttle exit. It was featureless, except for a few small round windows dotting the walls. Arman was just able to make out the exterior wall of a large metallic building. Everything else was obscured by a dark blue haze.

As the passengers made their way down the tunnel, there was a cry as the man behind Arman crumpled to the floor. Arman spun around, wincing as he felt the gravity tug sharply on his ankle. With help from the man next to him, Arman awkwardly managed to squat down and get his arms under the fallen man's shoulders. Repeated heavy clunks signaled that the armored man was approaching. He stood next to them as they struggled to get the fallen man to his feet. Crackle… “Yup, broken ankle. You two carry him through Customs, med bay’s inside.” The clunks resumed as the armored man made his way back to the head of the column.

“What the hell man? Broken ankle, didn’t you get skeletal supports?” said Arman.

“I thought the Ewei model was good enough, it was half price” whined the man.

“God damnit, now we gotta carry your cheap ass through Customs.” said Arman as he and the other man slung an arm each of the injured man over their shoulders. “What’s your name anyway?”

“Usman… Thank you for helping me.” said Usman, wincing with each step.

“And yours?” Arman looked at the other man.

“I’m Marcos.” he said.

The ungainly trio began to pant heavily as they labored to the end of the tunnel, accompanied by occasional grunts of pain from Usman. By the time they reached the end, the column had already passed them. They stepped through into a wide room with a low ceiling, where a man in uniform, flanked by two more armored men, was already addressing the shuttle passengers.

“-are valued here on Poena Station. We recognize the incredible service you are doing for Nuilea and want you to know we do not take it lightly. Your contributions will help us here on Poena Station, and across all of Nuilea, allowing our great nation to prosper and ensuring it’s security and economic vitality. No effort is too little or too great towards such a worthy cause, and the--”

Arman’s mind began to wander as the uniformed man’s voice faded to a drone. With his feet feeling a little steadier underneath him now, he took a moment to examine the equipment of the armored men. Each set of armor showed subtle differences in curvature and size. Must be custom printed, he thought. They were armed with Callistar .32 mag rifles. Capable of piercing class 5 armor at up to 3000 meters. Odd. Poena couldn’t be more than 1000 m wide in any direction. He hadn’t seen gear like that in a while.

“-part of the Poena community. But that will be for tomorrow. As for tonight, Corporal Jax will escort you to your dormitories, and tomorrow you will be shown your assignments. I look forward to seeing you all in the future, gentlemen.”

With that the uniformed man turned around and left and the column began to shuffle out after Corporal Jax.

“What a fucking windbag.” said Marcos.

They heard a speaker crackling and laughter from the armored man nearest them. The man walked over and said,

“I’m Private Yan. I’m taking you to the med bay, but you two still have to carry him. Follow me.”

They trudged along behind the armored man, who showed no indication of impatience at their slow pace.

After limping through several blank corridors, Arman said,

“That’s a hell of a rifle you got there, you expecting trouble?”

“We don’t expect anything civvy, mind your business.”
