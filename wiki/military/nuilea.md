# Nuilean Military

A rising military power built around scarcity discipline and industrial militarism.

## Ship Design Philosophy

Nuilean shipbuilding has a recognizable philosophy: **bulk, shielding, redundancy, and maintainability**.

Foreign engineers call Nuilean hulls *"dirty fusion ships"* because Nuilea accepts:
- Higher radiation budgets
- Heavier shielding
- Less elegant reactor cycles

In exchange for **operational autonomy**.

## Why They Look Different

### Helium-3 Constraint
Aneutronic fusion cycles are constrained by supply. Nuilea leans on reactor cycles that are:
- Easier to fuel domestically
- But more neutron-heavy and harsher on components

### Consequences
- More shielding mass
- More heat management hardware
- More replaceable internal modules
- Lower elegance, higher ruggedness

Nuilean ships are **slower to build but harder to kill politically**—they keep running under harsh conditions and degraded supply.

## Design Traits

- **Brutalist massing**: Thicker structural members, simple stress paths
- **Overbuilt radiators**: Large, segmented, replaceable panels
- **Modular reactor bays**: Hot swaps and emergency isolation
- **Service-first interiors**: Corridors, crane points, standardized connectors
- **Dirty exhaust**: Aggressive plume profiles, less stealth emphasis

## Doctrine Alignment

Nuilean ship design aligns with strategy:
- Survive long logistics lines
- Operate under comms/sensor disruption
- Accept inefficient energy cycles for fuel independence
- Leverage [[technology/mazer-relay-network|MRN]] support when available

## Cultural Note

- Nuilean crews see Mesulean ships as "spoiled": elegant, fuel-rich
- Mesulean crews see Nuilean ships as "dangerous junk": too hot, too loud

Both stereotypes are wrong in useful ways.
