# Mesulean Lunar Empire (MLE)

The largest great power in conventional military and industrial terms, ruling over the 113 moons of [[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulea]].

## Government Structure

### The Atrunean Emperor
**Ceremonially**, the ruler of the MLE is the [[factions/atruna|Atrunean]] Emperor. However, this is purely ceremonial—the true face of Mesulean politics is the Regent.

### The Mesulean Regent
- Does not officially belong to any political faction
- **Serves for life**
- Does not have unlimited power—most powers are deadlocked without Senate support, and vice versa

### The Senate
Each Mesulean moon has representation based on population:
- **1 seat per billion inhabitants**
- **Minimum of 1 senator** per moon
- Senators are **elected by the citizenry**

### Citizenship
Most inhabitants are citizens, with the exception of **landed immigrants**.

## Strategic Position

- Major advantage through **helium-3 accessibility at scale**
- De facto monopoly on the strategic fuel that powers high-performance spacecraft
- Can pressure [[factions/nuilea|Nuilea]] economically through fuel markets

## Signature Setpieces

- **Atmospheric helium-3 mining**: Storm culture, [[locations/mesulea/aeolus-station|Aeolus Station]]
- **Compartmented dark-state projects**: [[locations/mesulea/minos-crater|Minos Crater]] black-site

## Character

Mesulea is not cartoon-evil, but it is willing to do terrible things when it believes survival and dominance require it. The [[locations/mesulea/minos-crater|Minos Crater]] facility represents the lengths Mesulea will go to maintain its position.
