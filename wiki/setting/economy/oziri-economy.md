# Oziri Economy

Oziri is a **pirate nation-state** embedded in an alien megastructure—but economically, it functions as a **rough port-city** with markets, labor, security, and bureaucracy, all run by criminals with incentives to keep the machine running.

**Population**: ~180 million (concentrated in major warrens like Zirta)

---

## Economic Character

Oziri's economy is defined by three facts:

1. **It cannot feed itself**: Oziri lacks agricultural capacity and critical industrial inputs
2. **It is unconquerable**: The Vey shell makes military conquest impossible
3. **It has things others want**: Strike craft, salvage materials, deniable services, deep markets

This creates an economy based on **access and protection**:
- Oziri sells access to its markets and expertise
- Oziri sells protection from its own raiders
- Oziri serves as neutral ground for deals that can't happen elsewhere

The [[polities/oziri-council|Oziri Council]] maintains just enough order to keep commerce flowing without becoming a real government.

## Primary Industries (Strengths)

### Strike Craft Manufacturing — **Dominant**
- Single-pilot interceptors (#1 in system)
- Torpedo boats and gunships
- Boarding cutters
- Fast attack craft

**Why Oziri builds the best:**
- **Pilot culture**: Individual combat skill is celebrated; pilot feedback drives design
- **Iteration speed**: No certification regime, no safety boards—if it works, ship it
- **Combat data**: Oziri pilots actually fight; they know what matters
- **Desperation engineering**: When your life depends on your ship, you optimize differently

### Stealth & Special Operations Vessels — **Dominant**
- Covert insertion craft
- Reconnaissance ships
- Sensor-spoofed raiders
- Experience matters more than theory

### Combat Avionics & Targeting — **Leading**
- Fire control systems
- Sensor packages tuned for combat
- Electronic warfare modules
- Designed by people who use them

### Retrofit & Modification — **Leading**
- Stealth packages
- Weapon mount conversions
- Sensor spoofing installations
- Performance tuning
- "We'll make your ship do things the manufacturer didn't intend"

### Salvage & Reverse Engineering — **Unique**
- **Vey-derived materials**: Structural alloys from the planetary shell
- Not "technology"—no one understands how the Vey made it
- But the materials themselves are useful: incredible strength, strange properties
- Slow, careful extraction from accessible shell sections

### Gray & Black Markets — **Dominant**
- Anything with plausible deniability
- Goods that can't be sold openly elsewhere
- Information brokering
- Identity services
- Deep market for almost anything

---

## Secondary Industries (Competitive)

### Ship Repair & Maintenance — **Strong**
- Docking facilities in various factions' territories
- Combat damage repair
- Refitting captured vessels
- "No questions asked" service

### Weapons Manufacturing — **Competitive**
- Personal weapons
- Ship-mounted systems
- Boarding equipment
- Drones and autonomous systems
- More artisanal than Nuilean mass production

### Risk Services — **Unique**
- Money laundering
- Asset recovery (theft)
- Mercenary contracts
- Protection (legitimate and extortion)
- Intelligence and information

### Drug Production — **Present**
- Unlicensed pharmaceuticals
- Recreational substances
- Some legitimate chemical production
- Depends on imported precursors

---

## Agriculture & Food

### Cannot Feed Itself — **Critical Dependency**
- Oziri lacks agricultural land
- Some hydroponics and vat protein in warrens
- But nowhere near sufficient for 180 million people
- **Food is the primary strategic vulnerability**

### Food Sources
- Imports through immunity-deal corporations
- Freehold intermediaries
- Captured cargo (limited, unreliable)
- Council maintains strategic food stockpiles

**Food security drives much of Oziri's diplomatic behavior.**

---

## Energy Sector

### Fuel Acquisition — **Gray Market**
- He-3 through intermediaries and immunity-deal corps
- Captured cargo
- Tritium more accessible (less traceable)
- Strategic fuel stockpiles maintained by Council

### Internal Power
- Fusion reactors in major warrens
- [[locations/oziri/hive/fusion-reactor-complex|Fusion Reactor Complex]] in The Hive
- Must import reactor components and fuel

---

## The Immunity System

The core mechanism of Oziri's formal economy:

### How It Works
1. **Petition**: Corporation requests protected status from Council
2. **Fees**: Ongoing payments to Council treasury
3. **Trade commitments**: Must do business through Oziri markets
4. **Restrictions**: Can't transport military cargo for hostile powers
5. **Council vote**: Different clans have different interests; approval isn't automatic

### What Protected Status Gets You
- Raiding your ships becomes a **Compact violation**
- Other clans will punish the offender
- Access to Oziri markets and repair facilities
- Informal intelligence on pirate activity

### Why Corps Accept It
- Cheaper than losing ships
- Access to Oziri's unique goods and services
- "Cost of doing business" in the outer system
- Some corps profit more from Oziri access than they'd lose to raids

---

## Economic Vulnerabilities

### Food Dependency
- The critical weakness
- Must maintain relationships to keep food flowing
- Council stockpiles provide buffer, not solution
- A coordinated embargo would be catastrophic

### Legitimacy Gap
- "Pirate nation" limits formal trade relationships
- Corps that deal openly face reputational risk
- Insurance doesn't cover Oziri routes well
- Stuck in gray zone

### Import Dependency
- Can't make industrial tooling
- Can't refine chemicals at scale
- Dependent on outside world for manufacturing inputs
- Limiting factor on growth

### The Compact's Fragility
- Immunity system works on trust
- One major breach could collapse the system
- Factions have incentives to cheat
- Requires constant Council vigilance

### Brain Drain
- Skilled workers may leave for safer lives
- Must pay premiums for critical labor
- Rotational contracts aren't the same as permanent population
- Long-term sustainability question

- **Imports**: Goods through intermediaries
- **Character**: Officially hostile; some gray-market flow

### With Nuilea
- **Exports**: Some strike craft (through cutouts)
- **Imports**: Weapons, chemicals, modules (through cutouts)
- **Character**: Officially hostile; practically sells to anyone

### With Atruna
- **Exports**: Almost nothing officially
- **Imports**: Very limited
- **Character**: Officially distant; Atrunean insurance avoids Oziri

### With Freeholds
- **Exports**: Strike craft, salvage, services
- **Imports**: Food, materials, transshipment
- **Character**: Key intermediary; Freeholds connect Oziri to inner system

### With Hespers
- **Exports**: Anything Hespers want to buy
- **Imports**: Anything Hespers want to sell
- **Character**: Profit engine; corridor windows are gold rush
- Oziri is often the Hespers' first stop (close to corridor, eager to trade)

## The Corridor Window Economy

During [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor windows]], Oziri's economy transforms:

### What Changes
- Hesper traders arrive with exotic goods and hard currency
- Demand for local products spikes
- Prices for everything fluctuate wildly
- Every faction wants a piece of the action

### Council Response
- "Truce mode": stricter neutral-ground enforcement

- Heavy emphasis on predictable, profitable operations

### Why It Matters
- Corridor windows are **economically explosive**
- Months of premium prices and unique trade opportunities
- Factions that position well become much richer
- Factions that disrupt face collective punishment

---
