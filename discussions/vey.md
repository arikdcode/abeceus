# The Vey

**Human exonym:** *The Vey* (Atrunan linguistics tag degraded over centuries; original self-designation is not recoverable in human language).
**Role in the setting:** Builders of Oziri’s planetary shell and the ancient **transit lattice** that modern humans only partially exploit.

The Vey are not treated as mystics or “space gods.” They are a civilization whose power came from **infrastructure**: anchors, containment systems, and protocol-locked networks designed to outlast political cycles by orders of magnitude.

---

## Core thesis

The Vey believed that **constraint is safety**.

They built systems that reduce degrees of freedom:
- Travel is allowed only where it is *stabilized*.
- Access is granted only where it is *compliant*.
- Catastrophes are kept *local* through hard boundaries.

Oziri is best understood as a **node** in that philosophy: a combined anchor + containment + hardening object.

## Biology and cognition (high-level)

Most human understanding is inference from artifacts and environmental assumptions. The following is the most widely accepted model among serious researchers.

### Probable origin environment
A **cold, high-pressure** world (thick atmosphere and/or subsurface ocean under ice), with strong gradients and long-term stability constraints.

Implications:
- Comfort with pressure and stratified environments.
- Cultural obsession with containment, regulation, and long-duration control.

### Body plan (non-humanoid)
- Radial, semi-soft organism with internal structural spars (pressure-tolerant).
- Manipulation optimized for fluids and flexible tools rather than rigid “hand” tools.
- Primary senses likely emphasized **chemistry**, **pressure/vibration**, and broad-spectrum **electromagnetic field perception**.

### Mind style
- Excellent at long-horizon planning, control systems, redundancy, and failure analysis.
- Less emphasis on improvisation and rapid adversarial adaptation than humans.
- Strong aversion to unbounded novelty and uncontrolled variance.

## Culture and values

### Three inferred axioms
1. **Boundaries create meaning.**
2. **Stability enables growth.**
3. **Uncontained novelty is contamination.** (biological, memetic, political)

The Vey were not “order worshippers.” Their values are best modeled as survival instincts transformed into civilizational doctrine.

### The Conservancies
The Vey appear to have organized into administrative lineages (human term: **Conservancies**) responsible for classes of infrastructure:
- Anchor maintenance
- Transit governance
- Habitat regulation
- Deep resource extraction
- Containment and “hygiene” systems

Status likely correlated with **reliability over centuries**, not charisma or conquest.

### Aesthetic
Vey constructions present as “boringly perfect” until the scale becomes apparent:
- Layered materials with symmetrical stress paths
- Redundant load lines and graceful deformation tolerances
- Surfaces optimized for function and maintainability, not ornament

Oziri’s shell reads like Vey art: **structural truth at planetary scale**.

## Technology philosophy

### “Unfair engineering”
The Vey’s advantage is not one magic invention; it is a stacked competence:
- Extreme materials science (atomically regular alloys, carbon lattices)
- Autonomous maintenance designed for geological timescales
- Precision field control (sensing and shaping environments)
- **Protocol-locked infrastructure**: systems that simply will not function outside defined constraints

### Their FTL model: the transit lattice
The Vey did not rely on freeform FTL drives. They built (or adopted and perfected) a **transit lattice**:
- Wormhole-like transits that only stabilize **near engineered anchors**
- Travel behaves like a **rail network**, not personal vehicles
- Governance and safety are encoded into geometry + compliance rules

This fits their culture: constrain travel to prevent runaway expansion and localize disaster.

## Oziri as a Vey node

Oziri’s planetary shell is not merely armor. It is one component of a node designed to do three things simultaneously:

1. **Anchor / stability cage**
   A deep core structure (not fully mapped) creates boundary conditions required to stabilize lattice endpoints.

2. **Containment and hygiene**
   Internal geometry and material properties act as filters and buffers: biological, radiological, and informational. The Vey treated uncontrolled biospheres as hazardous ports.

3. **Hardening against interference**
   The shell is engineered to survive extreme assault to prevent node failure. The design priority is continuity, not comfort.

## Why the Vey are “gone” (choose later, keep ambiguous)

Human scholarship clusters around three compatible hypotheses. Any campaign can confirm one, several, or none.

### Dial A: The Retreat
After a lattice-era accident (biohazard, memetic collapse, runaway replicator, protocol disaster), the Vey retracted:
- Locked down most nodes
- Left anchors in minimal safe mode
- Reduced outward presence intentionally

### Dial B: The Schism
Conservancies split between “tight constraints” and “expansion” doctrines. The conflict was protocol warfare:
- Access rule changes
- Network orphaning and rejoining
- Anchor bricking and safe-locking

### Dial C: The Slow Death
No apocalypse. Just time:
- Caution outpaced innovation
- Population dwindled or transformed beyond human detection
- Maintenance systems continued because they were designed to

## Why learning about them matters

Studying the Vey reveals practical truths that shape modern power:
- **Chokepoints beat fleets** when the chokepoints are engineered into physics
- **Protocol is a weapon** when access is the true currency of infrastructure
- **Longevity engineering** changes what “empire” means
- **Containment-first design** implies the Vey feared certain failure modes more than enemies

---

## Integration with current canon

- Oziri’s shell perfection aligns with a civilization whose art is redundancy and stress-path clarity.
- A corridor endpoint that must open near Oziri aligns with anchors as required boundary conditions.
- Modern human “FTL” (Hesper wormholes) is best understood as **compatibility-layer use** of an ancient lattice, not independent mastery.

---

## Open questions (intentionally unanswered)

- What specific hazard(s) did Vey containment systems anticipate?
- Was the lattice built for commerce, quarantine, or control?
- Do any Conservancies or Vey-descended intelligences persist in hidden form?

These are setting levers: answer them only when the campaign wants the truth.
