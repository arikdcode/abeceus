# Setting & Canon

Core constraints and tone for the Abeceus setting.

## Tone

- **Gritty and realistic** — believable adult economics and geopolitics
- **Not fully dystopian** — stability exists alongside localized brutality
- **Mil-sim feel** — logistics, doctrine, budgets, and operational limitations matter
- **Spy-thriller layer** — secrets exist and can be uncovered

## Technology Constraints

- **No casual FTL** — space travel is high-performance STL: expensive, fuel-intensive, operationally constrained
- **Helium-3 is strategic** — enables lighter, higher-performance reactor and propulsion profiles
- Advanced infrastructure exists but must be expensive, politically contested, and not so abundant it breaks power structures

## Secrets Constraint

- Secrets and alien artifacts can exist in multiple places
- They should be **discoverable**, **localized**, and **high-value**
- They reshape incentives and create crises, not instantly rewrite the economy
