# Atruna

The remarkably Earth-like world that attracted the original colonists a millennium ago.

## Planetary Characteristics

- Temperate climate
- Breathable O₂/Ar atmosphere
- Strong magnetic field
- Oceans and continents
- 0.98 g surface gravity
- Wild fauna

## Background

The modern inhabitants of the wider Abecean system are descended from the original colonists of Atruna. After being cut off from Earth, Atruna retained scientific understanding in their databanks, but with a low population and no access to Earth's vast pool of expertise, they had to rebuild engineering and industrial capability from scratch. It took many centuries to match what Earth had before contact was lost.

## Political Status

- Lost position as primary power centuries ago
- Maintains close diplomatic ties with former colonies (Mesulea, Nuilea)
- Considered **neutral ground** for ceremonies and diplomacy
- Mesulean and Nuilean governments integrate Atrunean ceremonial functions
