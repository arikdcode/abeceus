# Tomás Kriel

**Role**: Ludrion underground rail operator
**Age**: 43
**Base**: Bastion Sol, Ludrion
**Affiliation**: Ludrion Rail Authority (civilian, non-aligned)

## Background

Tomás has been running cargo trains on the Ludrion underground rail for nineteen years, starting at 24 after a two-year mechanic's apprenticeship in Bastion Sol. He didn't have the grades or connections for the engineering programs and didn't want to go into the mines. The rail was hiring, the pay was decent, and he liked the quiet.

He's one of roughly thirty operators who run the deep trunk lines between Ludrion's three Op-Centers. The routes are long — Bastion Sol to Aurelius Hub is nearly four hours through deep rock. He's alone in the cab with the hum of the electric drive and the sound of tunnel walls sliding past. Most people would go stir-crazy. Tomás finds it meditative.

He knows every stretch of tunnel by sound. The pitch of the rails changes where the rock composition shifts. There's a particular echo near the old junction at kilometer 118 where a maintenance branch splits off. The ventilation fans at the midpoint stations have a rhythm he can practically hum. Nineteen years of the same tunnels, day after day, has given him an almost preternatural sensitivity to changes in his environment.

## Personality

Tomás is quiet and steady. Not shy — he'll hold a conversation easily — but he doesn't seek attention. He's the kind of guy people talk to because he's unhurried, doesn't gossip, and is always passing through. He's not a friend to most people, exactly. More like a fixture. The train guy.

He's not political. Doesn't care much about which power controls which Op-Center. While most Ludrion residents live and work within one Op-Center and rarely visit the others, rail operators get a transit pass that grants free movement through all three zones. Tomás badges through the checkpoints, exchanges a nod with the guards, and keeps moving. He drinks at bars in all three Op-Centers — a beer or two after a run before catching the deadhead train home to Sol. Nineteen years of that means he knows people everywhere. Maintenance crews, dock workers, customs officers, miners.

He's accidentally become an information node. He crosses all three zones regularly, talks to ordinary workers in each one, hears things over beers. Separately, none of it means anything. Together, he's absorbed a picture of Ludrion that very few people have — not because he sought it out, but because he's been a quiet, reliable fixture in the social fabric of three different communities for two decades.

## Current Situation

Two things have unsettled Tomás's routine:

### The Vibrations

About eight months ago, he started noticing vibrations on the Sol-Aurelius deep trunk that weren't there before. Not train vibrations — something deeper, more rhythmic. Like heavy machinery, but far below the rail level. It happens in a specific 20-kilometer stretch around kilometer 80-100, where the tunnel passes through deep basalt near the Nuilean-Mesulean territorial boundary.

He reported it to the maintenance office. They told him it was probably seismic survey work for the new uranium prospecting contracts. That made sense for about a month. Then he noticed the vibrations only occur during overnight shifts — never the daytime runs. Seismic surveys don't keep a schedule like that.

He's mentioned it to a few other operators. One or two have noticed it too but shrugged it off. Most haven't — they don't have Tomás's sensitivity to tunnel acoustics after nineteen years.

### The Missing Foreman

[[characters/dasha-vorn|Dasha Vorn]], a mining foreman from Lumina and a regular at a Lumina bar Tomás frequents, stopped showing up about six weeks ago. Nobody seems to know where she went. Or more accurately, nobody wants to talk about it. The bartender changed the subject. A mutual acquaintance got uncomfortable and said Dasha "transferred to a deep project."

Tomás hasn't formally connected these two things. He's not an investigator — he's a train driver. But he has a low-level unease that something is happening underneath the tunnels he's ridden for two decades. And he's the kind of person who notices when things change in his environment, because his whole world is rhythm and routine.

## What Tomás Doesn't Know

*(GM information — not known to the character)*

The vibrations are from a covert Nuilean deep-mining operation. Nuilean engineers are boring a vertical shaft from near the Sol-Aurelius trunk line down to approximately 12 kilometers depth, where they have identified a massive deposit of [[locations/ludrion/kessrite-deposit|kessrite]] — a naturally occurring superconductor crystal — straddling the Nuilean-Mesulean territorial boundary.

The deposit sits just across the subsurface boundary line in technically Mesulean-claimed territory. The bulk of the engineering is vertical (12km down), with a short horizontal bore (2-3km) crossing beneath the territorial boundary to reach the richest concentration. The Ludrion Accords are silent on subsurface mineral rights at this depth — nobody was thinking about 12km-deep mining when the Accords were written — but the political reality is clear: Mesulea would consider this theft from their territory and an act of aggression.

Nuilea learned about the deposit through [[characters/fen-daratic|Fen Daratic]], a corrupt Mesulean geological surveyor who detected anomalous seismic readings from the Lumina-Aurelius trunk line and sold the data to Nuilean intelligence rather than filing it through Mesulean channels. Nuilea then confirmed the deposit with targeted surveys from their own Sol-Aurelius tunnel, triangulating the exact location using both datasets.

The drilling happens exclusively during overnight rail shifts to minimize detection risk. [[characters/dasha-vorn|Dasha Vorn]] was recruited into the project for her deep-basalt expertise — approached through a cutout, offered exceptional pay, and made to understand that the job is classified. She has no communication with the outside world for the duration of the operation.

The fact that Tomás has picked up on the vibrations, and is asking around about Dasha, makes him a potential security risk — though Nuilean intelligence hasn't flagged him yet. He's just the train guy.

## Potential Plot Hooks

- **The curious operator**: PCs encounter Tomás at a bar in Aurelius Hub. He's not looking for trouble, but he's the kind of guy who'll mention something offhand about the tunnels not sounding right if the conversation goes that way. If the PCs show interest, he's a willing (if nervous) guide.

- **Dasha's disappearance**: PCs might be hired to find Dasha Vorn — perhaps by a family member, a partner, or a Lumina-based employer who needs her back. The trail leads through Tomás, who was one of the last people in regular social contact with her.

- **Nuilean cleanup**: If Nuilean intelligence eventually flags Tomás as a risk, they might try to silence or relocate him quietly. The PCs might witness this or be hired to protect him.

- **The guided tour**: Tomás knows the maintenance tunnels, the old junctions, the abandoned branches. He can take the PCs off the main rail network and into the deep infrastructure where few people go. Whether they're investigating the vibrations, looking for Dasha, or just trying to move unseen between Op-Centers, Tomás is the best guide on the planet.

- **Accidental whistleblower**: If the PCs discover what's being mined and the information gets out, Ludrion could become a flashpoint. Tomás — the quiet train driver who just noticed a funny sound — would be at the center of it.
