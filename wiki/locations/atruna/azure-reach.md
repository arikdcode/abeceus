# Azure Reach Resort

A once-luxurious coastal resort on Atruna's western continent, now a sealed quarantine zone and a grim reminder of the dangers of intelligence operations on neutral ground.

*Azure Reach in its glory days: cliffside villas, pristine beaches, crystal waters. What lurks in the shadows would change everything.*

## Overview

Azure Reach was built 140 years ago on a pristine stretch of Atrunean coastline, featuring white sand beaches, turquoise waters, and dramatic cliff-side villas. For over a century, it served as the premier meeting place for diplomats, executives, and elites from across the system. The resort's neutral location and reputation for discretion made it ideal for backdoor negotiations and informal summits.

At its peak, Azure Reach hosted 2,000 guests and employed a staff of 800. The complex included:
- 12 luxury hotels and villa compounds
- Private landing pads for shuttle traffic
- Underground conference facilities with advanced security
- Multiple fine dining establishments
- Recreation facilities (pools, yacht harbor, spa complexes)
- A small supporting town (population ~3,000) in the nearby valley

## The Incident

### The Outbreak (12 ABY)

On Founding Day 12 ABY, during the height of the summer diplomatic season, a pathogen was released throughout the resort's environmental systems. Within 6 hours, the first cases presented with severe symptoms. Within 24 hours, the entire resort was in crisis.

Initial symptoms:
- High fever and flu-like presentation
- Rapid progression to hemorrhagic symptoms
- Severe neurological complications (paranoia, extreme aggression, loss of inhibition)
- Personality fragmentation and psychotic episodes
- Highly contagious via airborne and fluid transmission

The Atrunean government enacted an immediate quarantine. Military units sealed all access routes. No one was permitted to leave the quarantine zone.

### The Official Story

According to the Atrunean government's official report:
- The pathogen was a weaponized agent developed by Oziri terrorists
- An Oziri operative infiltrated the resort and released it during the diplomatic season
- The attack was designed to destabilize neutral ground and sow chaos
- Of the approximately 5,800 people within the zone, all contracted the pathogen
- **There were no survivors** - the pathogen was 100% lethal
- The site remains permanently quarantined due to environmental contamination
- The bodies were too dangerous to recover and were left in place

Oziri vehemently denied all involvement. International investigators found the evidence "suggestive but not conclusive." The case remains officially unsolved.

The "no survivors" story was carefully chosen - it eliminates the need to produce living witnesses, and any claims of seeing living people inside can be dismissed as hallucinations, scavengers, or conspiracy theories.

### The Truth

The official story is a lie. The pathogen was Atrunean.

**Project SUBVERSION** was an unauthorized black ops program run by a rogue cell within the [[organizations/aia|Atrunean Intelligence Agency]]. The goal: develop a pathogen that would make infected individuals receptive to subliminal commands and suggestion while appearing neurologically normal.

The plan was elegant in its horror:
- Foreign leaders and diplomats would stay at Azure Reach
- Environmental systems would expose them to the pathogen
- They would return home, unknowingly compromised
- Atrunean intelligence could then manipulate them through carefully crafted stimuli
- Atruna's declining power could be arrested through covert control of other governments

When Emperor Tashen IV discovered the program, he ordered it terminated immediately. But the intelligence cell had already gone too far to stop.

**The Final Act:**

Senior Intelligence Officer Valen Morrec, a zealous nationalist, believed the program was Atruna's only hope against being eclipsed by Mesulea and Nuilea. When the shutdown order came, he made a choice.

The scientific team refused to release an unfinished pathogen - it had severe, uncontrolled side effects. Morrec executed four scientists and fled with viable samples. He infiltrated Azure Reach's environmental systems and released the pathogen into the resort.

The virus spread to everyone in the facility. But it didn't create compliant puppets. The infected descended into violent psychosis while retaining basic cognitive function - they could find food, operate equipment, and organize into crude hierarchies. But they killed any uninfected person on sight with savage brutality.

Morrec himself was infected. The official AIA report states he died in the initial chaos. **This is a lie.**

### The Cover-Up

The Atrunean government faced an impossible situation:
- A diplomatic catastrophe on neutral ground
- Thousands of foreign nationals dead or infected
- Evidence of an illegal bioweapon program
- Potential collapse of Atruna's neutral status

The decision was made at the highest levels: **blame Oziri**.

- Evidence was fabricated pointing to Oziri bioweapon research
- The story of a terrorist infiltration was constructed
- International investigators were given access to curated intelligence
- The few Atrunean officials who knew the truth were sworn to secrecy or eliminated
- Records of Project SUBVERSION were destroyed

But the cover-up required an additional, darker decision.

### The Living Quarantine

The infected did not die. The pathogen stabilized after the initial outbreak, leaving approximately 4,100 people alive but irrevocably insane. They remain at Azure Reach to this day.

**What the Government Discovered:**
- The infected are sustained by the pathogen itself - **their aging has slowed dramatically**
- After 140+ years, most infected appear to have aged only 20-30 years physically
- They form crude social structures, operating the resort to meet basic needs
- They show coordinated hunting behavior against intruders
- They exhibit signs of collective behavior that suggests residual connection to the pathogen's original mind-control mechanisms
- Some infected show varying degrees of lucidity - moments where their original personality surfaces before being subsumed again

### Valen Morrec Lives

The AIA's official internal report claims Valen Morrec died in the initial outbreak chaos. This is false. Morrec survived his own infection - and unlike most infected, he retained far more of his cognitive function.

**The Infected King:**

Morrec's background as a senior intelligence officer and military veteran gave him skills that translated terrifyingly well to his new existence. While most infected operate on instinct and fragmented memory, Morrec retained his tactical brilliance, his ability to plan, and his capacity for manipulation.

Over the decades, he rose to dominance among the infected:
- He coordinates hunting parties with military precision
- He organizes the infected into functional units
- He maintains the resort's critical infrastructure
- He has established a crude hierarchy with himself at the apex
- Other infected defer to him through a mix of fear and the pathogen's residual collective programming

Morrec is not sane. The pathogen has twisted his mind, amplifying his paranoia, his nationalism, and his capacity for violence. But he is **functional** in a way no other infected has achieved. He can hold conversations. He can plan. He can remember.

**The AIA's Dark Bargain:**

Approximately 40 years after the outbreak, the AIA discovered Morrec was still alive and lucid. After several disastrous attempts to eliminate him, they made a pragmatic decision: negotiate.

The current arrangement:
- Morrec helps the AIA study the infected population
- He provides tissue samples from deceased infected
- He reports on the pathogen's long-term effects on his own cognition
- He maintains enough order among the infected to prevent mass escape attempts
- In exchange, the AIA provides him with specific supplies, equipment, and information

The relationship is deeply uncomfortable. Morrec is a mass murderer and a monster. But he's also the only window into understanding the infected from the inside. The AIA officers who maintain contact with him describe the experience as "negotiating with a rabid wolf that somehow learned to speak."

**Morrec's Psychology:**

Morrec genuinely believed he was saving Atruna when he released the pathogen. In his twisted mind, he was a patriot making the ultimate sacrifice. When the AIA covered up the incident and blamed Oziri, he expected to be remembered as a hero once the truth eventually emerged.

Instead, he was erased. Left to rot with his victims. Forgotten by the nation he destroyed himself for.

140 years of infection, isolation, and betrayal have transformed his fanatical nationalism into something darker: **hatred**. He despises the AIA. He despises Atruna. He despises the Immortality Consortium that profits from his victims' suffering while leaving him to die in a quarantine zone.

He wants revenge. And he's been planning it for decades.

### Operation EXODUS

The AIA doesn't know it, but Morrec has been playing them for years.

**The Tunnel:**

Using infected labor coordinated over decades, Morrec has been excavating a tunnel from the resort's underground conference complex ("The Vault") toward the perimeter. The work is painstakingly slow - the infected can only dig during periods of lucidity, and progress is measured in meters per year.

The tunnel is now approximately 200 meters from breaching the quarantine perimeter. At current pace, it will be complete within 18 months.

**The Operational Plan:**

Morrec's military training hasn't faded. He's developed a sophisticated extraction plan:

1. **Breach**: Tunnel emerges 3km from the perimeter, in a blind spot between sensor arrays
2. **Diversion**: Infected create multiple disturbances at the perimeter to draw military response
3. **Insertion**: Morrec and a small team of the most functional infected move through the tunnel
4. **Target**: The spec-ops spaceport 12km from the quarantine zone - lightly defended, used for covert supply runs
5. **Seizure**: Ambush and eliminate spaceport personnel, seize a shuttle
6. **Extraction**: Rendezvous with allied vessel in low Atruna orbit

**The Oziri Connection:**

Morrec's masterstroke: he's made contact with Oziri pirates.

Using equipment obtained through his "cooperation" with the AIA, Morrec managed to send encrypted transmissions beyond the quarantine zone. He reached out to Oziri intelligence with an offer they couldn't refuse:

*Help me escape, and I'll give you everything. Documentation proving the pathogen was Atrunean. Evidence of the cover-up. Names of AIA officers involved. Proof that Oziri was framed.*

For Oziri, this is the opportunity of a century. Definitive evidence that could destroy Atruna's credibility and potentially collapse the entire diplomatic order of the system.

An Oziri pirate vessel, operating under false transponder codes, now maintains periodic orbit around Atruna. They're waiting for Morrec's signal.

**What Morrec Wants:**

Morrec's goals have evolved beyond simple revenge:
- **Expose the truth**: Burn Atruna's reputation to the ground
- **Destroy the Consortium**: Release evidence of the immortality research to the public
- **Freedom**: Live what remains of his twisted life outside the quarantine
- **Legacy**: Be remembered as the man who brought down the system's greatest lie

He doesn't care about the chaos this will cause. He doesn't care about the infected he'll leave behind. He doesn't care about the geopolitical consequences.

He just wants them all to suffer like he has.

**The Ticking Clock:**

The AIA has no idea how close Morrec is to executing his plan. They believe their arrangement with him is stable. They don't know about the tunnel. They don't know about the Oziri contact.

Within 18 months, Valen Morrec will either escape and burn the system down - or something will stop him.

This is perhaps the most dangerous secret in Azure Reach: not just what happened 140 years ago, but what's about to happen next.

**The Real Prize: Immortality**

The mind-control program was a failure. But the pathogen's unintended side effect - dramatically slowed aging - is potentially the most valuable discovery in human history.

Every elite in the Abeceus system, regardless of national allegiance, wants to live forever. The anti-aging properties of the Azure Reach pathogen represent a potential path to functional immortality. If the mechanism can be isolated and the psychotic side effects eliminated, it could extend human lifespans by centuries.

This changes everything about the conspiracy.

**Current Operations:**

The Atrunean military maintains the quarantine under the pretense of environmental contamination. The real research is focused on immortality:
- Automated systems airdrop food and medical supplies monthly to keep the subjects alive
- Remote sensors and drones continuously monitor the infected population's health markers
- Tissue samples are periodically recovered from deceased infected for analysis
- Specialized research teams work to isolate the anti-aging mechanism from the neurological effects
- The goal is not to cure the infected - it's to harvest their secret

**The Immortality Consortium**

The conspiracy extends far beyond Atruna.

A small number of extremely powerful individuals across multiple powers know the truth about Azure Reach - and they're more interested in living forever than in national allegiances:

- **Atrunean elites** who control the research directly
- **Mesulean corporate executives** who fund parallel research in exchange for access to findings
- **Nuilean oligarchs** who have quietly invested in the program
- **Freehold magnates** who provide logistical support and money laundering
- Even some **Oziri lords** who know they were framed and have leveraged that knowledge for access

These individuals form an unofficial consortium, bound by mutual interest in immortality and mutual assured destruction if the truth emerges. They meet in secret, share research findings, and coordinate to ensure the conspiracy remains hidden.

For them, the infected are not victims - they are **research subjects** whose suffering may unlock eternal life.

**Casualties and Truth:**

Everyone in the zone was infected. Their families were told they died in the outbreak. Some were paid off. Others had unfortunate accidents when they asked too many questions.

**The Death Toll:**
- Security forces who initially entered the quarantine: 140 killed
- Journalists who got too close to the truth: 6 confirmed, more suspected
- Atrunean officials who opposed the cover-up: unknown number
- AIA scientists who tried to reveal the truth: 3 confirmed dead
- Civilians who breached the perimeter: dozens over the years

### Suspicions and Investigations

Despite the official story, many suspect the truth is darker:

**Oziri's Position:**
- They maintain complete innocence and lack any bioweapon program of this sophistication
- They point out the evidence appeared too conveniently
- Some Oziri factions conduct their own investigations, but Atrunean intelligence actively sabotages them

**Mesulea and Nuilea:**
- Both powers have intelligence suggesting Atrunean involvement
- Neither has conclusive proof, and both benefit from keeping Oziri as the system's pariah
- Some intelligence officers suspect the infected are still alive but have no evidence
- Unofficial doctrine treats the official story as "useful fiction"

**The Freeholds:**
- Several independent investigations have gotten uncomfortably close to the truth
- Two journalists were killed in "accidents" after publishing preliminary findings
- The Freeholds generally believe Atruna is hiding something but lack resources to prove it

**Conspiracy Theories:**
- The infected are still alive (TRUE, but dismissed as paranoid fantasy)
- The pathogen was meant as a mind-control weapon (TRUE, but considered absurd)
- The Atrunean government is studying the infected (TRUE, but "impossible to maintain such secrecy")
- Some infected have escaped and are living in normal society (FALSE, but popular in horror media)
- The pathogen grants immortality (TRUE, but sounds like fantasy)
- Powerful elites across multiple powers are secretly collaborating on research (TRUE, but dismissed as paranoid conspiracy-mongering)
- The whole thing was an Atrunean operation, not Oziri (TRUE, but considered pro-Oziri propaganda)

## Current Status

### The Quarantine Zone

Azure Reach remains under permanent military quarantine. The Atrunean government maintains an extensive perimeter:
- Multiple rings of automated defense systems
- Regular aerial patrols via drone
- Advanced sensor networks monitoring all activity
- Heavy military presence at checkpoints
- Shoot-on-sight authorization for perimeter breaches

The official position is that environmental contamination makes the site too dangerous to enter. The real reason: the infected are still inside, alive and active.

### Inside the Zone

The infected population has been surviving for over 140 years. Drone surveillance and remote sensors reveal a disturbing picture:

**Population:** Approximately 3,800 infected remain alive (down from 4,100 initial). The pathogen appears to slow aging dramatically - most infected show physical appearance consistent with only 20-30 years of aging despite over a century passing.

**Behavior Patterns:**
- The infected maintain the resort in a crude fashion, operating generators, securing food storage
- They form hierarchical groups, with "alpha" individuals controlling territories
- They communicate through a mix of distorted speech and animalistic vocalizations
- They display coordinated hunting behavior when intruders are detected
- Moments of disturbing lucidity have been documented - infected completing complex tasks or speaking coherently before relapsing

**How They Survive:**
- Monthly airdrops of food, water, and medical supplies (disguised as environmental monitoring equipment)
- The resort's industrial food storage and aquaculture systems are still partially operational
- Some infected display knowledge of equipment maintenance
- Greenhouse facilities in the villa compounds produce limited fresh food
- The pathogen itself appears to reduce metabolic needs

**The Resort:**
- Main buildings show signs of ongoing habitation - fires, crude repairs, makeshift barriers
- Some areas are heavily damaged from violence and decay
- Others are eerily maintained, as if staff still operated them
- The harbor's yachts have been repurposed as shelters and watchtowers
- Clearwater Valley town is mostly ruins, with infected using it as a secondary territory

### Access Restrictions

Entry to the zone is absolutely prohibited:
- Multiple military checkpoints on all approaches
- Naval patrols along the coastline
- No-fly zone enforced by automated defense systems and fighter patrols
- Attempted entry is met with immediate lethal force
- Officially: 20+ years imprisonment for trespass
- Actually: Intruders who reach the perimeter are typically disappeared

### The Reports

Despite heavy suppression, reports leak out:
- **Lights moving in the buildings** at night (REAL - the infected are active)
- **Coordinated movements** of figures visible from offshore (REAL - hunting parties)
- **Sounds** of distorted voices and screams (REAL - the infected communicate)
- **Disappearances** of boats that stray too close (REAL - infected have killed maritime intruders)
- **Government supply drops** happening regularly (REAL - but officially denied)

The Atrunean government aggressively suppresses these reports:
- Witnesses are discredited, threatened, or paid off
- Media outlets are pressured not to publish stories
- Independent investigators face legal harassment
- Some witnesses have simply vanished

### Breaches and Casualties

Over 140 years, there have been numerous breaches:

**Scavengers:** Dozens have tried to loot the resort. Few return. Those who do report "things that used to be people" hunting them through the buildings. Most are dismissed as traumatized or lying.

**Intelligence Operations:** Mesulean and Nuilean intelligence have attempted infiltration to gather evidence. At least 8 confirmed operatives have been lost inside the zone. Their bodies were later recovered showing signs of extreme violence.

**Researchers:** Several scientific expeditions attempted to enter, seeking pathogen samples. None succeeded. Two teams were entirely lost.

**Dark Tourists:** The resort has morbid appeal. Over the years, at least 30 civilians have attempted to enter. Body counts vary. Some are intercepted by military. Others make it inside and are never seen again.

**The Breach of 67 ABY:** A group of Freehold journalists managed to evade the perimeter and entered with recording equipment. They transmitted footage for approximately 40 minutes before going silent. The footage showed:
- Infected individuals moving through the resort
- Evidence of ongoing habitation
- A coordinated assault by infected on the journalists' position
- Final transmission: screaming and pleas for help

The Atrunean government seized all copies of the transmission and arrested anyone who possessed it. The journalists were officially declared "missing, presumed dead in accident." Three family members who demanded answers died in "unrelated incidents" over the following year.

## Cultural Impact

### The Azure Reach Accords

In the aftermath of the incident, all major powers signed the Azure Reach Accords, establishing:
- Restrictions on bioweapon research and stockpiling (widely ignored)
- Intelligence oversight mechanisms (largely toothless)
- Protocols for outbreak response on neutral territory
- Compensation framework for civilian casualties in covert operations

The Accords are cynically viewed as theater. Every major power knows the Atrunean explanation is suspect, but the Accords allow them to pretend otherwise while pursuing their own covert programs.

### In Popular Culture

Azure Reach has become a dark legend:
- Symbol of intelligence operations spiraling catastrophically out of control
- Subject of countless horror stories, conspiracy theories, and urban legends
- "Going to Azure Reach" as slang for a doomed situation
- Horror films depicting the infected as mindless monsters (closer to truth than people realize)
- Conspiracy media claiming the infected are still alive (dismissed as paranoid fantasy, despite being true)
- Annual memorial services for families of victims (who don't know their loved ones still technically "live" inside)
- Whispered rumors about elites seeking immortality from the quarantine zone (dismissed as jealous fantasy)

**Common Cultural Tropes:**
- "The things at Azure Reach" - referring to the infected as something no longer human (ironically accurate)
- Nightmare imagery of luxury resorts as death traps
- Stories of lone survivors escaping the quarantine zone (impossible according to official story, but persistent in fiction)
- Romance tragedies of lovers separated by the outbreak
- Rich patrons secretly seeking immortality from dark sources (closer to truth than anyone realizes)

### Political Legacy

The incident permanently altered system politics:

**For Atruna:**
- Reinforced image as neutral ground defender, despite being the actual perpetrator
- Strengthened Atrunean intelligence services, who leveraged the crisis to expand power
- Created a permanent secret that could destroy Atruna's diplomatic standing if revealed
- Led to doctrine of "plausible elimination" for those who get too close to the truth

**For Oziri:**
- Devastating blow to reputation, despite complete innocence
- Provided justification for increased economic sanctions
- Made Oziri the system's convenient scapegoat
- Strengthened Oziri's paranoia about frame jobs and conspiracies (which proved justified)

**System-Wide:**
- All powers expanded biodefense and bioweapon programs
- Neutral-ground diplomacy became more difficult
- Intelligence services became more careful about domestic operations
- Created precedent for blaming Oziri when operations go wrong
- Contributed to Freehold militarization and distrust of great powers

## Geography

The resort is located on the Azure Coast of Atruna's western continent, approximately 800 km from the capital. The coastline features:
- White sand beaches extending for 15 km
- Dramatic limestone cliffs rising 200 meters above the sea
- Sheltered bay ideal for yacht mooring
- Temperate climate with mild winters
- Rich marine ecosystem (formerly a tourist attraction)

The nearby town of Clearwater Valley, built to support the resort, is also within the quarantine zone. It was a picturesque settlement built into the hillside overlooking the coast.

## Notable Features

### The Grand Atrium

The centerpiece of the main hotel, a 12-story open atrium with glass ceiling. This was where the first cases were identified. Images of the abandoned atrium, with furniture still arranged and crystal chandeliers hanging overhead, have become iconic.

### The Clifftop Villas

A series of ultra-exclusive villas built into the cliffside, accessible only by private funicular. Several high-ranking diplomats and corporate executives died in these villas. Their contents remain as they were left.

### The Underground Conference Complex

Known as "The Vault," this secure facility was built to host sensitive negotiations. It featured advanced security, soundproofing, and signal isolation. The complex is rumored to contain evidence about the outbreak that was never officially recovered.

### Memorial Obelisk

Erected just outside the quarantine perimeter, the obelisk lists the names of all 5,800+ victims - officially, everyone who was inside the resort when the outbreak occurred. It has become a pilgrimage site for those affected by the tragedy.

The bitter irony: most of the names on the obelisk belong to people who are still technically alive inside, trapped in violent insanity while their families mourn at a monument to their "deaths."

## Adventure Hooks

### Infiltration Missions

**"The Vault Retrieval"**: PCs are hired (by foreign intelligence or private interests) to infiltrate Azure Reach and recover specific documents from the underground conference complex. The data could prove Atrunean involvement or reveal other state secrets. They must evade military patrols, breach the perimeter, navigate a decaying resort full of infected, and extract before they're killed by either threat.

**"The Sample"**: A corporation or foreign power needs pathogen samples for vaccine research (or weaponization). The PCs must infiltrate, locate infected individuals or viable samples, secure them, and escape. Complications: the infected hunt in packs, the military is watching, and extraction becomes a nightmare.

**"Recovery and Retrieval"**: A high-ranking official's family member was at Azure Reach when it happened. They want definitive proof of death or, terrifyingly, confirmation if they're still alive inside. The PCs must locate a specific infected individual among thousands and bring back evidence. Moral question: do they reveal that their target is still "alive" but irreversibly insane?

### Investigation & Conspiracy

**"The Journalist's Legacy"**: The PCs acquire fragments of the seized footage from the 67 ABY breach. They must investigate what happened, determine the truth, and decide whether to expose it. Atrunean intelligence is actively hunting anyone with copies. The conspiracy goes deeper than they know.

**"The Whistleblower"**: An aging AIA scientist who worked on the original cover-up contacts the PCs. They're dying and want the truth revealed. They'll provide evidence and access codes, but Atrunean intelligence will stop at nothing to silence them and anyone they've contacted.

**"The Pattern"**: A foreign intelligence service has noticed patterns in Atrunean supply shipments. They hire the PCs to investigate, leading to the discovery that supplies are being sent into the "abandoned" quarantine zone. Following this thread reveals the infected are still alive and being maintained.

### Survival Horror

**"Breach"**: The PCs are at Azure Reach on a legitimate mission (perhaps unaware of the true danger) when something goes catastrophically wrong. They find themselves inside the perimeter with infected hunting them. They must survive, escape, and deal with the knowledge that what they saw contradicts everything they were told.

**"Containment Failure"**: Intelligence suggests infected may have breached the perimeter. The PCs must track down and eliminate escaped infected before they spread the pathogen - or before the Atrunean government eliminates everyone who knows about the breach, including the PCs.

**"Dark Tourism Gone Wrong"**: The PCs are hired to extract a group of wealthy thrill-seekers who broke into Azure Reach and are now trapped. Rescue mission becomes survival horror as they discover the infected are far more dangerous and organized than anyone outside the government knows.

### Military & Government

**"Black Site Inspection"**: The PCs are Atrunean military or intelligence, assigned to routine perimeter patrol or supply drop. They're not supposed to know the truth, but circumstances force them to enter the zone or witness something that can't be explained by the official story. Now they must decide: maintain the cover-up or risk everything for truth?

**"Termination Protocol"**: Atrunean intelligence learns that Mesulean or Nuilean operatives are planning a major infiltration to gather proof. The PCs are sent to intercept and eliminate them - but discover the infiltrators have legitimate evidence of Atrunean guilt. Do they complete the mission or help expose their own government?

**"The Cure"**: Atrunean intelligence has made a breakthrough - a potential cure or a way to complete the original programming. The PCs are part of a team sent to test it on infected subjects. They must capture specific infected, administer the treatment, and observe results. Things go wrong when they realize some infected remember who they were and what was done to them.

### Moral Complexity

**"Mercy or Murder?"**: The PCs discover that a loved one (family member, old friend, former colleague) was at Azure Reach and is still alive inside, infected. Do they attempt a rescue knowing there's no cure? Do they try to end their suffering? Do they leave them to their fate?

**"The Ethics of Study"**: The PCs learn the truth about the ongoing research and supply drops. The infected are essentially prisoners in an open-air laboratory, kept alive for study. Some in the government want to terminate them all to hide the evidence. The PCs must decide whether the research justifies the horror, or if the infected should be euthanized.

**"Witness Elimination"**: The PCs are approached by someone who has proof of the conspiracy - or they themselves are the witnesses. Now Atrunean intelligence is hunting them. They must stay alive long enough to expose the truth, escape to safety, or negotiate some kind of deal. But the government has killed for this secret before and will again.

### The Immortality Conspiracy

**"The Consortium"**: The PCs stumble upon evidence that powerful figures across multiple powers - Atrunean, Mesulean, Nuilean, even Oziri - are secretly collaborating on Azure Reach research. These elites care more about living forever than national loyalty. The PCs must navigate a conspiracy that transcends borders, where enemies in public are partners in private, and exposure would destabilize the entire system.

**"The Offer"**: A wealthy patron approaches the PCs with an offer: retrieve tissue samples from Azure Reach, and they'll be paid enough to retire forever. But as the mission progresses, they realize their patron is part of the Immortality Consortium, and the samples are for research that will benefit only the ultra-wealthy. Do they complete the job? Sabotage it? Try to steal the research for themselves or the public?

**"Breakthrough"**: The Consortium's research has achieved a breakthrough - they've isolated the anti-aging mechanism and are ready to test a refined version. The PCs are hired (or stumble into) either protecting the test subjects, sabotaging the test, or stealing the formula. The implications are staggering: if it works, immortality becomes real - but only for those who can afford it.

**"The Insider"**: A disillusioned member of the Consortium contacts the PCs. They've grown disgusted by what they've been part of and want to expose everything. But the Consortium has members in every major power, and the insider doesn't know who to trust. The PCs must protect them long enough to release the truth - while being hunted by assassins from every faction.

### The Morrec Situation

**"First Contact"**: The PCs are AIA operatives assigned to the Azure Reach liaison team - the handful of people who maintain contact with Valen Morrec. Their job is to negotiate, gather intelligence, and keep the arrangement stable. But something feels wrong. Morrec is too cooperative. Too helpful. What is he planning?

**"The Tunnel"**: Intelligence suggests unusual seismic activity beneath the quarantine zone. The PCs are sent to investigate - and discover evidence of excavation. Someone is digging out. The race begins to find and collapse the tunnel before Morrec completes his escape route.

**"Intercept"**: Oziri pirate communications have been decoded. A vessel is planning a covert rendezvous in Atruna orbit. The PCs must intercept, board, and discover what cargo - or passenger - they're expecting to pick up. What they learn changes everything.

**"Operation EXODUS"**: The tunnel is complete. Morrec is moving. The PCs are the rapid response team scrambling to stop a breakout that could destabilize the entire system. They must fight through infected, reach the spaceport before Morrec, and prevent the shuttle from launching. Failure means the truth comes out - catastrophically.

**"The Other Side"**: The PCs are Oziri operatives. Their mission: extract Valen Morrec from quarantine and bring him - and his evidence - back to Oziri space. They're helping a monster escape, but the evidence he carries could finally clear Oziri's name after 140 years of false blame. Is justice worth unleashing Morrec on the system?

**"Morrec's Gambit"**: Morrec has escaped. He's released partial evidence to the press, causing chaos. Now he's offering to sell the rest - the complete documentation of the Immortality Consortium - to the highest bidder. Every faction wants him: dead, captured, or allied. The PCs are caught in a system-wide manhunt for the most dangerous man alive.

**"The Interview"**: A journalist or researcher has arranged, through extraordinary means, to interview Valen Morrec inside the quarantine zone. The PCs are hired as security. But Morrec has his own agenda for this meeting - and the PCs may be pawns in a game they don't understand.
