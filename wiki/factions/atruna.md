# Atruna

The original colony and long-standing cultural core of the Abeceus system.

## Political Character

- Rich and influential through diplomacy, institutions, and legacy authority
- Militarily significant but not the dominant hegemon
- Considered neutral ground for major ceremonies and diplomacy

## The Atrunean Intelligence Agency (AIA)

A highly decentralized intelligence organization with no direct leader. Every operative knows at most 1% of the structure.

### NEXUS

The agency operates through an anonymous distributed network called **NEXUS**:
- Hosted on nodes running secretly on civilian hardware across Abecean space
- Nodes expire and migrate, preventing targeting
- Can grow or cull itself by infecting hardware with node-instantiating worms
- Tracks operative connectivity; eliminates those who learn too much

### Information Bidding

- Operatives post intelligence to NEXUS's blockchain database
- Others bid cryptocurrency for access
- Successful bids pay the operative and release the information

### Recruitment

No formal process—operatives can deputize non-operatives. This means AIA operatives can be anyone: military, criminals, store clerks, officials, prostitutes, carpenters.

### Orphaned Networks

Nodes can become disconnected, forming parallel NEXUS networks that occasionally rejoin. These subnetworks can post conflicting work orders, sometimes causing civil wars within the intelligence community.
