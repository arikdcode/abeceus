# The Oziri Corridor

The **Oziri Corridor** is the common Abecean name for the Hespen wormhole route into Abeceus space. The corridor does not open arbitrarily: it must stabilize **near Oziri**, placing the corridor mouth within Oziri’s effective fast-strike reach.

This single constraint reshapes the entire system’s geopolitics.

## Core premise

### The corridor must open near Oziri
Abeceans do not fully understand why, but the corridor endpoint behaves as if it requires **local stability conditions** that exist only in Oziri’s vicinity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that:
- Hespen transit taps into an older alien lattice, and
- Oziri contains a stabilizing “anchor” structure the lattice depends on.

Regardless of mechanism, the consequence is simple: **Oziri gets first contact by default.**

## The Window

The corridor is usable only during a limited period known as **the window**.
- The window is predictable enough to schedule around, but not so predictable that it is risk-free.
- When the window opens, traffic becomes the system’s top strategic priority.
- When it closes, the system returns to its “normal” balance of power.

## Oziri’s leverage: proximity denial

The corridor mouth lies within a range where Oziri’s forces can impose continuous attrition on any fleet attempting to loiter nearby.

Abecean powers can attempt to mass forces near the corridor, but:
- maintaining a permanent posture close to Oziri carries unacceptable ongoing losses,
- and forcing Oziri to stop would require a full-scale campaign (blockade + bombardment + invasion),
  which the inner powers have already attempted historically and are reluctant to repeat.

Thus, Oziri enjoys a de facto **proximity veto** over corridor access.

---

## The Corridor Truce

During the window, the system informally enters a **Corridor Truce**:
- Oziri does not prey on Hespen shipping (practical, profit-motivated).
- Major Abecean powers avoid open warfare near the corridor mouth.
- Factions maneuver through proxies, contracts, bribery, and “security arrangements.”

The truce is not moral. It is practical:
- everyone benefits from trade,
- and everyone knows violence risks collapsing the entire opportunity.

When the window closes, most factions revert to normal behavior patterns.

## Mesulea–Oziri corridor arrangement

One established working assumption:
- The Hespers strongly value **helium-3**.
- Mesulea is the only Abecean power with truly abundant, scalable helium-3 supply.

A plausible corridor-era arrangement:
- Oziri permits Mesulean bulk He-3 shipments to access corridor trade lanes
- in exchange for a negotiated cut, fees, or other concessions
- while rivalry and raiding resume outside the truce window

This relationship is openly cynical and widely resented, but stable enough to persist.

## Effects on the rest of Abeceus

### Atruna
- Leverages diplomacy and soft power to gain a “civilized mediator” role during the truce.
- Uses corridor periods to reaffirm influence despite weaker military weight.

### Nuilea
- Treats corridor windows as both opportunity and humiliation:
  access to high-value markets is filtered through Oziri’s pirate regime.
- Pursues independence programs (e.g., BLUESPIRE) partly to avoid negotiating from weakness.

### The Freeholds
- Do not control the corridor, but can become essential as financiers, manufacturers, or neutral facilitators.
- Corridor trade magnifies their influence even if they never fire a shot.

### The Belt / O’Neill clusters
- Corridor windows trigger hiring booms, security contracts, and shipping surges.
- “Normal life” continues, but pricing, shortages, and sudden fortunes ripple outward.

---

## What keeps it from collapsing into constant war
- Oziri does not want to provoke the Hespers: they are a cash machine.
- Inner powers do not want to destroy the trade opportunity they also profit from.
- The cost of “solving Oziri” militarily is immense and politically toxic.

The corridor turns Oziri from a persistent nuisance into a strategic hinge—without making Oziri a conventional empire.
