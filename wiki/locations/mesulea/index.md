## Planetary Characteristics

- Jovian mass: 1.3
- Jovian radius: 1.5
- 113 moons
- Best source of helium-3 in the system

## The Mesulean Lunar Empire

| Moon | Role |
|------|------|
| [[locations/mesulea/miezo|Miezo]] | Capital (2nd largest) |
| [[locations/mesulea/vierko|Vierko]] | Industrial center (3rd largest) |
| [[locations/mesulea/klato|Klato]] | Financial capital (4th largest) |
| [[locations/mesulea/sume|Sume]] | Agricultural breadbasket (largest, terraformed atmosphere) |

## Helium-3

Mesulea's atmosphere contains helium-3 in high concentrations, especially in storm systems. This strategic resource powers aneutronic fusion reactors—smaller, less massive, more efficient than neutronic alternatives.

Mesulea's de facto monopoly on helium-3 gives them major leverage over their rival [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilea]].
