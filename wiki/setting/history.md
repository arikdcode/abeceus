# History & Timeline

## Major Eras

### Early Colonization

- [[locations/atruna/index|Atruna]] settled by Earth colonists over a millennium ago
- Contact with Earth lost; colonists were cut off from Earth's vast expertise
- Scientific knowledge retained in databanks, but engineering capability had to be rebuilt from scratch over centuries

### Expansion Period

**~150 years after Atrunean planetfall:**
- First major colonization effort: [[locations/mesulea/miezo|Miezo]] (Mesulea's capital moon)
- Minor colonization efforts had been ongoing since earliest days

**~200 years after Atrunean planetfall:**
- Major colonization of [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilea]] begins
- Fewer resources devoted compared to Mesulea
- Greater distance from Atruna and lack of accessible Helium-3 made it less attractive

### Rise of the Mesulean Lunar Empire

- [[factions/mesulea|Mesulea]] grows into the dominant power through helium-3 monopoly
- 113 moons developed with outposts, settlements, and cities
- [[locations/atruna/index|Atruna]] loses position as primary power but retains cultural and diplomatic influence

### Rise in Space Piracy

As the Mesulean and Nuilean colonies matured and interplanetary trade increased, space piracy became a serious problem:

- **Abecean flares** gave pirates windows to attack while ships' sensors/comms were shielded
- [[factions/atruna|Atruna]] and [[factions/mesulea|Mesulea]] expanded their fleets but couldn't escort all trade vessels
- Military focus: seek and destroy pirate bases in the asteroid belt
- Millions of asteroids made this nearly impossible

**The Turning Point:**
- Successful pirates became wealthy enough to acquire advanced long-range drives
- Extended striking range allowed retreat to outer system, including [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]]
- Pirate Lords began claiming sections of the Oziri megastructure
- Marketplaces for legal and illegal trade emerged
- Mass migration to Oziri began

### The Oziri Conflict

*Main article: [[setting/oziri-conflict|The Oziri Conflict]]*

As Oziri grew in power, the [[factions/mesulea|Mesuleans]] and [[factions/atruna|Atruneans]] launched a joint military campaign to eliminate this threat. The campaign ended in catastrophic failure:

- Naval bombardment futile against the [[species/vey|Vey]]-built planetary shell
- Ground assault faced impossible odds in the labyrinthine warrens
- Tens of thousands of Atrunean casualties
- Atrunean withdrawal after public pressure
- Failed Mesulean blockade due to ground-to-orbit attrition

The conflict proved Oziri unconquerable and led to the [[#The Pirate Compact|Pirate Compact]].

### The Pirate Compact

Following the failed conflict, the Pirate Lords recognized they needed to avoid provoking another invasion:

- Targets selected carefully—never raid same corporations too often
- Pirates faded from escalating menace to "persistent nuisance"
- Inner systems accepted some piracy as the new normal
- **Formalized in a written agreement**: greedy pirates face wrath of other pirates

### Modern Era

**Current State of Powers:**
- [[factions/mesulea|Mesulea]]: Dominant power via helium-3 hegemony
- [[factions/nuilea|Nuilea]]: Rising challenger pursuing independence programs
- [[factions/atruna|Atruna]]: Diplomatic and cultural core, neutral ground
- [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]]: Functioning criminal nation-state
- [[factions/freeholds|The Freeholds]]: Inner-system third pole

**Recent Developments:**
- Discovery/stabilization of the [[projects/oziri-corridor|Oziri Corridor]]
- [[factions/hespers|Hesper]] trade windows reshape economics
- Nuilea's [[projects/bluespire|BLUESPIRE]] and [[projects/janus|Janus II]] programs threaten status quo
