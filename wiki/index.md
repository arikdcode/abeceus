# Welcome to the Wiki

This is your Obsidian-compatible wiki. Add your content here using standard Markdown and Obsidian features:

- **Wiki Links**: Use `[[Page Name]]` to link between pages
- **Tags**: Add `#tag-name` anywhere or use frontmatter tags
- **Folders**: Organize pages into folders as you like

## Getting Started

Create new `.md` files in this `wiki/` folder to add pages. The folder structure becomes your wiki's navigation.

## Example Links

- [[characters/index|Characters]]
- [[locations/index|Locations]]
- [[timeline/index|Timeline]]
