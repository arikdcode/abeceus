# Oziri Council

The governing body of [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]], composed of representatives chosen by the most powerful factions on Oziri—mostly pirate lords.

## Nature of Oziri Governance

Oziri's pirate clans are not merely raiders. They function as the **governing class** of a fortified city-world embedded in an alien megastructure.

Oziri's survival depends on being:
- **Profitable enough** that outsiders tolerate it
- **Orderly enough** that commerce keeps flowing
- **Dangerous enough** that coercion is too costly

## Council Responsibilities

The Council oversees policy decisions affecting Oziri as a whole:

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Space patrol** | Each faction contributes military units to patrol Oziri space, protecting from imperial incursions |
| **Docking rights** | Assignment of docks and lanes |
| **Taxation** | Fees and maintenance obligations |
| **Policing** | Neutral-ground enforcement |
| **Resource stockpiles** | Management of food, water, air, industrial consumables |
| **Corporate immunity** | Determining which corporations are protected from raiding |
| **Foreign policy** | Especially critical during [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor windows]] |

## Decision Making

Council decisions are **not democratic**. They are **negotiated power settlements** between factions with competing interests.

## The Pirate Compact

Following the [[setting/oziri-conflict|Oziri Conflict]], the Pirate Lords formalized their approach in a written agreement:

### Core Terms
- Select targets carefully
- Never raid the same corporations too often or too close together
- **If any Pirate Lord or independent pirate becomes too greedy, they face the wrath of the others** for bringing danger upon all

### Neutral Ground Rules
The Compact stipulates restrictions on altercations on **neutral ground**:

**Protected Areas:**
- Commercial districts
- Residential districts
- Administration districts
- Oziri shipping lanes
- Space above commercial docks

**Enforcement:**
- Brawls between warring factions on neutral ground are **generally ignored**
- **Killing on neutral ground earns a death sentence**

This restriction allows parties doing business on Oziri to feel insulated from violence, preventing loss of business for all factions.

## Law and Order

Stability is enforced through a mix of:
- **Reputation and economic incentives**
- **Selective brutality**: High-certainty punishment for certain "red lines"
- **Private enforcement arms** aligned with Council factions

### The Pattern
- Violence is tolerated in the "right places"
- Commerce is protected in designated neutral districts and lanes
- Killing on protected ground triggers severe, rapid retaliation

**Oziri's order is not moral. It is functional.**

## Logistics Reality

To survive, Oziri must secure:
- Food, water, air processing
- Medical supply chains
- Replacement parts and industrial feedstocks
- Technicians and labor

This is achieved through:
- Trade and brokerage (legal and illegal)
- Protection contracts
- Selective raiding that avoids triggering total war
- Internal production in districts capable of manufacturing and recycling

Oziri looks less like a gang hideout and more like a **rough port-state**: markets, labor, security, and bureaucracy, all run by criminals with incentives to keep the machine running.

## Corporate Relationships

The relationships between pirates and corporations are dynamic and complex:

- Some corporations are **targeted by raids**
- Corporations doing business on Oziri are **protected from raiding** by the Council
- Getting **immunity status** can be politically tricky:
  - Some factions may want to do business with a corporation
  - Others may want to raid them
- Most factions are involved in other commerce besides raiding, creating **diverse interests**
- Different interests and schemes are what **lead factions into war with each other**

## Corridor Windows

During [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor windows]], Oziri governance shifts into **"truce mode"**:
- More centralized lane control
- Stricter neutral-ground enforcement
- Aggressive counter-sabotage
- Heavy emphasis on predictable, profitable operations

Outside windows, Oziri reverts to its normal pattern:
- Opportunistic raiding (carefully bounded)
- Factional feuds contained to non-critical zones
- Commerce as the constant glue holding it together

## Reputation and International Relations

### The Azure Reach Frame Job

The [[timeline/azure-reach-incident|Azure Reach Incident]] (12 ABY) remains the most devastating blow to Oziri's reputation - made worse by the fact that **they were completely innocent**.

The bioweapon outbreak at [[atruna/azure-reach|Azure Reach Resort]] infected over 4,100 people and resulted in a permanent quarantine. The Atrunean government's investigation concluded the pathogen originated from Oziri bioweapon research.

**The Truth:**
The pathogen was Atrunean, developed by a rogue AIA cell in an unauthorized mind-control program. When the operation failed catastrophically, the Atrunean government fabricated evidence and framed Oziri to hide their own guilt.

**Oziri's Position (Actually Correct):**
- Complete denial of involvement - they had no such bioweapon program
- Claims evidence was planted to frame them - it was
- Points out Oziri lacked the scientific sophistication for such a weapon at that time - true
- Suggests the weapon could have originated from another power's black program - it did (Atruna's)
- Maintains the investigation was a sham designed to reach a predetermined conclusion - correct

**International Perception:**
Despite Oziri being innocent, the framing was successful:
- Most powers believe Oziri was involved, at minimum through negligence
- The incident "validated" existing prejudices about Oziri
- Led to increased economic sanctions and travel restrictions
- Damaged relationships with neutral trading partners
- Made corporate immunity negotiations significantly more difficult
- Positioned Oziri as the system's pariah and convenient scapegoat

**Impact on Oziri:**
- Prompted internal Council debates about whether to develop bioweapons defensively
- Some factions pushed to actually create bioweapon programs in response
- Others argued focusing on proving their innocence was more important
- Led to expanded intelligence operations seeking proof of the frame job
- Increased Oziri's reliance on the Freeholds as trading intermediaries
- Deepened Oziri paranoia about conspiracy and persecution - which proved justified

### The Investigation That Never Was

Oziri has conducted its own investigations over 140 years:
- Multiple intelligence operatives lost attempting to infiltrate Azure Reach
- Evidence gathered suggesting the infected are still alive inside
- Reports of ongoing Atrunean supply drops to the "abandoned" zone
- Forensic analysis showing the pathogen markers are inconsistent with Oziri capabilities at that time
- Witness testimony from individuals who later died in "accidents"

Despite accumulating evidence of Atrunean guilt, Oziri has never been able to prove it conclusively. The few times they've come close, witnesses died or evidence disappeared.

### The Bitter Reality

The Azure Reach Incident crystallized the system's view of Oziri as inherently dangerous and untrustworthy - based entirely on a lie. This perception continues to shape diplomatic and economic relations decades later.

**The Irony:**
- Oziri is punished for a bioweapon program they never had
- Atruna maintains its neutral ground status through the very deception that destroyed Oziri's reputation
- Other powers privately suspect the truth but find Oziri's guilt politically convenient
- Oziri's insistence on their innocence is dismissed as "what they would say anyway"

Some Council factions argue that since they're being punished for bioweapons anyway, they might as well actually develop them. Others maintain that doing so would make the false narrative true and vindicate the frame job.

The incident remains a source of bitter resentment and drives much of Oziri's antagonistic relationship with the rest of the system.
