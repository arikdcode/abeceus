# The Vey Anchor

The heart of [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]] - a contained singularity that serves as both the planet's eternal power source and the geometric foundation that allows the [[projects/oziri-corridor|Oziri Corridor]] to stabilize nearby.

## Overview

Deep beneath Oziri's 300-meter shell lies something humans barely understand: a primordial micro black hole, captured or engineered by the [[species/vey|Vey]] millions of years ago, modified in ways that violate what human physics considers possible.

The anchor is why Oziri matters. Without it, the planet would be a frozen rock at the edge of the system. With it, Oziri is a nexus - the only point in Abecean space where the ancient transit lattice can connect.

## The Singularity

### Physical Properties

- **Type**: Primordial micro black hole (possibly engineered)
- **Mass**: Estimated several billion metric tons
- **Size**: The event horizon is subatomic - smaller than a proton
- **Age**: Unknown, but stable against Hawking radiation decay for billions of years
- **Rotation**: Believed to be spinning rapidly (enables Penrose process energy extraction)

### The Regulated Naked Singularity

Under normal physics, a singularity is hidden behind an event horizon - an absolute boundary from which nothing escapes. The Vey changed this.

Using field geometries that human science cannot replicate or fully comprehend, the Vey created what physicists would call a "regulated naked singularity":

- The event horizon is **suppressed** in precisely controlled regions
- The singularity's spacetime-warping effects "leak" into normal space
- This leakage follows exact geometric patterns, shaped by containment fields
- The result is a stable, reproducible spacetime geometry

Imagine the event horizon as a curtain hiding the singularity's true nature. The Vey built a system that pulls the curtain aside in specific places, allowing the singularity's reality-bending properties to be *harnessed* rather than merely contained.

This "exposed" geometry creates the boundary conditions required for the transit lattice to connect - a socket into which wormhole endpoints can lock.

## Anchor Structure

The anchor is not simply a black hole in a box. It is a layered system of containment, shaping, and interface structures built to function autonomously for geological timescales.

### Layer 1: The Planetary Shell (Exterior)

*Human understanding: Extensive*

The 300-meter super-alloy shell that encases Oziri serves multiple purposes:
- Protects the anchor from external assault
- Prevents anchor effects from destabilizing the surface
- Provides structural framework for the interior systems
- Acts as first-stage containment for radiation and gravitational effects

This is the layer humans know well - they've mapped it, tested it, failed to breach it.

### Layer 2: The Buffer Zone

*Human understanding: Partial*

Between the shell and the deeper systems lies a network of tunnels, chambers, and support structures. This is where pirates live, where markets thrive, where human Oziri exists.

The buffer zone was not built for habitation - it was built for maintenance access and system redundancy. Humans simply moved in because it was available.

Gravitational anomalies increase with depth. The deepest inhabited areas experience subtle tidal effects - nothing dangerous, but noticeable. Clocks run slightly slower. Pendulums swing slightly wrong.

### Layer 3: The Lattice Interface

*Human understanding: Detected but not comprehended*

This is where the transit lattice "connects" to the anchor. Human instruments can detect this region:
- Spacetime appears "thin" - gravitational lensing effects visible without massive objects
- Exotic radiation signatures that match no known source
- The corridor endpoint consistently manifests within this zone's influence

Scientists theorize this is the "socket" - the geometric structure that allows wormhole endpoints to stabilize. They're correct, but they don't understand *how* it works.

### Layer 4: The Containment Array

*Human understanding: Barely glimpsed*

Massive field generators arranged in precise geometric patterns surround the core. Their purpose:
- Shape the singularity's exposed effects into useful geometry
- Maintain the regulated naked singularity state
- Prevent catastrophic containment failure
- Harvest energy from the singularity's various outputs

The containment array has been functioning autonomously for millions of years. Vey engineering included self-repair, self-calibration, and extraordinary redundancy. It will likely continue functioning for millions more.

The few human expeditions that reached this layer reported:
- Intense radiation requiring heavy shielding
- Visual distortions - light bending in ways that induced vertigo and nausea
- Equipment malfunctions - electronics behaving erratically near field generators
- A pervasive sense of *wrongness* that affected crew psychology

Most turned back. Those who pressed deeper into Layer 5 rarely returned intact.

### Layer 5: The Core

*Human understanding: None*

No human has reached the core and returned to describe it coherently.

Theoretical models suggest this layer contains:
- The singularity itself
- The primary field geometry that suppresses the event horizon
- Whatever exotic matter or energy the Vey used to achieve the impossible
- Systems for energy extraction and distribution

Survivors of deep expeditions describe:
- Time flowing at perceptibly different rates
- Visual phenomena that words cannot capture
- Memories that don't sequence correctly
- An overwhelming sense of presence - not intelligence, but *significance*

Whether these are physical effects of proximity to exposed singularity geometry, psychological breakdown from sensory overload, or something else entirely remains unknown.

## Power Generation

The anchor serves as Oziri's eternal power plant, providing energy through multiple mechanisms:

### Hawking Radiation Harvesting

The singularity emits a constant stream of Hawking radiation - particles created at the event horizon boundary. While the output is small for a black hole of this size, containment systems capture and convert this energy.

### Penrose Process

If the singularity rotates (which evidence suggests), energy can be extracted from its rotational momentum. Matter entering the ergosphere region can be accelerated and ejected at higher energy than it entered, effectively mining the black hole's spin.

### Gravitational Gradient Conversion

Mass falling toward the singularity releases enormous energy before crossing the point of no return. The Vey built systems to feed matter into carefully controlled trajectories, extracting energy from the acceleration.

### Output

The anchor produces more power than Oziri's current population could ever use. The pirates tap into distribution systems they don't understand, drawing energy from conduits the Vey built for purposes unknown.

Most of the anchor's output goes... somewhere. Into systems still functioning, still maintaining, still waiting. Humans don't know what for.

## Effects on Oziri

### The Corridor Connection

The regulated naked singularity creates precise spacetime geometry that the transit lattice recognizes as a valid endpoint. This is why the [[projects/oziri-corridor|Oziri Corridor]] must stabilize near Oziri - it's not arbitrary, it's architectural.

The Vey built the lattice. Oziri's anchor is a station on that lattice. The Hespers who use the corridor are simply traveling on infrastructure they didn't build.

### Gravitational Anomalies

The singularity's mass creates measurable but manageable gravitational effects:
- Surface gravity slightly higher than the planet's mass would suggest
- Tidal effects increase with depth
- Time dilation measurable in the deepest inhabited areas (clocks lose ~0.3 seconds per day relative to surface)

### The Deep Prohibition

The Oziri Council maintains an unofficial but strictly enforced prohibition on deep exploration. Officially, this is for safety. Unofficially, there are other reasons:

- Several expeditions have triggered automated defense responses from deeper systems
- Some returnees exhibited psychological changes that made them dangerous
- There are things down there that the current power structure doesn't want disturbed
- Legends suggest that waking the anchor's deeper functions could have catastrophic consequences

The pirates rule Oziri's upper layers. Something else - or nothing at all, just ancient machines following ancient protocols - governs the depths.

## Human Understanding

### What They Know

- The shell is impenetrable by current technology
- Gravitational anomalies indicate massive density deep inside
- The corridor endpoint requires Oziri's presence to stabilize
- Energy flows from somewhere deep to power systems throughout the structure
- Going too deep is dangerous

### What They Theorize

- A singularity or similar exotic object exists at Oziri's core
- The Vey built containment and shaping systems around it
- The anchor creates boundary conditions for lattice connectivity
- The system is self-maintaining and will outlast human civilization

### What They Don't Know

- How the Vey suppressed the event horizon
- What exotic matter or fields are involved
- Whether the anchor can be controlled, modified, or disabled
- What happens if it fails
- What else the anchor might be capable of
- Whether it's just a tool, or something more

## Strategic Implications

### For Oziri's Rulers

The anchor is why Oziri cannot be ignored. Any power that controls the anchor controls corridor access. But no one truly controls the anchor - they merely occupy space above it.

The pirate lords understand this implicitly: their power exists because the anchor exists, and the anchor exists independent of their power.

### For the Major Powers

If the anchor could be destroyed, Oziri would lose its strategic significance. The corridor would presumably fail or relocate. This has been considered.

The problem: no one knows how to damage the anchor, and no one knows what happens if they succeed. The Vey built for permanence. Attempting to break their work might do nothing, might succeed cleanly, or might trigger cascading failures no one can predict.

The anchor is not a weapon to be seized. It is terrain to be navigated.

### For Scientists

The anchor represents the single greatest repository of Vey technology in known space. Understanding it could revolutionize human science - materials, energy, spacetime manipulation, possibly even lattice travel.

But the anchor resists understanding. It functions. It does not explain.

## Mysteries

### Are There Other Anchors?

The Vey built a lattice with many nodes. Oziri is clearly one anchor point. Are there others?

- Within Abeceus? (No evidence found, but the system is vast)
- In Hesper space? (The Hespers aren't sharing)
- Elsewhere in the galaxy? (Unknown, possibly unknowable)

If other anchors exist, they might enable additional corridor connections - or they might be dead, damaged, or locked by protocols humans cannot bypass.

### What Happens If It Fails?

Theoretical scenarios:
- **Graceful shutdown**: Containment fields collapse inward, singularity returns to "normal" black hole state, corridor connection lost
- **Catastrophic release**: Naked singularity effects propagate outward, spacetime distortions tear Oziri apart
- **Lattice cascade**: Failure propagates through connected nodes, multiple anchors affected
- **Nothing**: The Vey built for redundancy; backup systems engage

No one wants to find out which scenario is correct.

### Is It Aware?

Some expedition survivors report a sense of *presence* near the core. Not intelligence in any recognizable sense, but... significance. Attention. Being observed by something that doesn't think but nonetheless *regards*.

This could be:
- Psychological effect of proximity to warped spacetime
- Interaction between human neurology and exotic radiation
- Autonomous systems responding to intrusion
- Something else entirely

The Vey philosophy suggests constraint, not consciousness. But the Vey are gone, and their works remain. What they built may have become something they didn't intend.
