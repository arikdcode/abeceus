# The Abeceus System

A unary star system colonized by humans from Earth over a millennium ago. After **The Scream** severed contact with Earth, the colonists built a civilization from scratch across multiple worlds and moons.

## Major Powers

- **[[locations/atruna/index|Atruna]]** — The original colony world, cultural heart of the system
- **[[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulea]]** — Gas giant empire, helium-3 hegemon
- **[[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilea]]** — Rising power, industrial militarism
- **[[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]]** — Pirate nation-state in an alien megastructure
- **[[factions/freeholds|The Freeholds]]** — Inner-system third pole

## The Setting

The Abeceus system is **gritty and realistic**, with believable economics and geopolitics. It's not fully dystopian—stability exists alongside localized brutality and systemic corruption. Logistics, doctrine, and budgets matter.
