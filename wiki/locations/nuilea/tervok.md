# Tervok

A mining moon in the [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilean]] system with concentrated deposits of rare earth elements. Supplements [[locations/nuilea/korvus|Korvus's]] mining operations with materials unavailable locally.

## Overview

[[locations/nuilea/korvus|Korvus]] has extensive mining operations for common industrial metals (iron, nickel, aluminum), but it lacks sufficient rare earth deposits. Tervok fills that gap. These elements—neodymium, dysprosium, lanthanum, and others—are essential for electronics, superconductors, and specialized alloys.

Even though Nuilea imports high-end components from [[polities/atruna|Atruna]], they still need raw materials for domestic production. Tervok provides them.

**Population**: ~8 million

## Operations

### Strip Mining

Large-scale surface extraction. Automated excavators tear into mineral-rich deposits, processing ore on-site to reduce transport mass. The landscape is scarred with open pits and tailings.

### Refining

On-site refining separates rare earth elements from ore. This is dirty, energy-intensive work—but shipping raw ore to Korvus would be wasteful. Refined materials are more valuable per kilogram.

### Quality Control

Rare earths are inputs for precision manufacturing. Quality matters. Tervok facilities maintain strict standards despite harsh conditions.

## Character

Dust everywhere—in the air, on surfaces, in lungs despite filtration. Mining operations run constantly. Workers rotate through extraction, processing, and maintenance in grueling shifts.

Tervok is considered a hardship posting. Pay is good, but conditions are rough. Many workers are contract laborers serving fixed terms before returning to more comfortable assignments.

## Strategic Significance

Rare earth independence reduces Nuilea's vulnerability to supply disruptions. If Atruna or Mesulea squeezed rare earth exports, Nuilea could fall back on domestic production—less elegant, but available.
