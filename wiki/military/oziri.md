# Oziri Military

Oziri's military capability is distributed across multiple factions coordinated by the [[factions/oziri-council|Oziri Council]].

## Defense Doctrine

Oziri's strategy is **defensive attrition**:
- The planetary shell is effectively impervious to orbital bombardment
- The labyrinthine interior defeats ground assault
- Any attacker faces unacceptable ongoing losses

## Space Patrol

Each Council faction contributes military units to patrol Oziri space:
- Protection from imperial incursions
- Lane security during [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor windows]]
- Enforcement of neutral-ground rules

## Ground Forces

Faction-aligned private forces provide:
- Security for holdings
- Enforcement of Council decisions
- Response to red-line violations

## Historical Performance

### The Oziri Conflict

*Main article: [[setting/oziri-conflict|The Oziri Conflict]]*

When [[factions/mesulea|Mesulea]] and [[factions/atruna|Atruna]] attempted a joint ground assault:
- Chaotic tunnels broke up signals and detection
- Marines in power armor faced endless killboxes
- Pirates knew the terrain; attackers walked in blind
- Tens of thousands of casualties for no meaningful progress

The battle-weary Atrunean populace forced withdrawal. Mesulea's subsequent blockade collapsed under attrition from ground-to-orbit weapons.

The conflict proved that Oziri's defensive doctrine works.

## Current Posture

Oziri does not seek to project power. It seeks to make coercion **too expensive to attempt**.
