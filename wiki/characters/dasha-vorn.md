## Background

Dasha grew up in Lumina, daughter of two refinery technicians. She was bright and physical — good with machines, comfortable in confined spaces, not interested in the clean-room precision work that Lumina values most. She apprenticed in mining operations at 18 and by her mid-twenties had earned a reputation as one of the best deep-rock specialists on Ludrion.

She spent a decade working Mesulean extraction sites — Iron Grasp Crater for three years, several smaller deep-bore operations in the mid-latitudes, and eventually earned her foreman's certification. Her specialty is deep basalt: understanding its fracture patterns, managing bore stability at extreme depth, and keeping crews alive in high-pressure, high-temperature environments. There are maybe a dozen people on Ludrion with her level of expertise in this niche.

## Personality

Dasha is direct, competent, and practical. She doesn't suffer fools, she doesn't do office politics, and she doesn't care about the rivalry between powers as long as the rock gets moved and nobody dies on her watch. She's well-liked by her crews because she's fair and she works as hard as anyone. She's respected by management because her operations run clean.

Off-shift, she's warmer than her work persona suggests. She's a regular at a Lumina bar where she drinks whiskey-equivalents and talks to whoever sits down. Tomás Kriel was one of those people — not a close friend, but a familiar face. The train guy who always had a beer at the end of his run and could hold a quiet conversation.

## Current Situation

*(GM information)*

Six weeks ago, Dasha was approached by a man she didn't know — well-dressed, calm, clearly not a miner. He said he represented a "deep infrastructure project" that needed someone with her exact skillset. The pay was exceptional: three years' salary for an estimated 8-12 month engagement. She would be working at extreme depth in challenging basalt, managing a small crew of specialists.

The pitch included a patriotic angle — "serving Nuilean strategic interests" — which Dasha found mildly distasteful (she's Mesulean, after all), but the money was persuasive. The catch: total communication blackout for the duration. No messages, no visits, no contact with anyone outside the project. She would effectively vanish.

Dasha accepted. She's not naive — she knows something about this is politically sensitive. But she's a mining foreman, not a spy. She doesn't know that the deposit she's helping extract is in Mesulean territory, or that the entire operation is a violation of the Ludrion Accords. She was told the site is in "deep Nuilean-claimed subsurface" and she had no reason to question it. She's 12 kilometers underground, managing bore stability and keeping her crew alive, focused on the work.

She doesn't know that people in Lumina have noticed she's gone. She doesn't know Tomás has been asking about her.

## What Makes Her Interesting

- She's a Mesulean citizen unknowingly helping Nuilea mine from Mesulean territory. If she finds out, her reaction is unpredictable — she might be furious, she might be pragmatic, she might try to get word out.
- She's underground with no communication. Reaching her means going 12km down through a covert Nuilean operation.
- If the PCs are looking for her, she's the proof that the operation exists. Finding her means finding the mine.
- She's competent and tough. If the PCs reach her and the situation goes sideways, she's not dead weight — she knows the deep tunnels and she can handle herself.

## Connections

- **[[characters/tomas-kriel|Tomás Kriel]]**: Bar acquaintance. Last person in her regular social circle to see her before she vanished. Currently asking questions about where she went.
- **[[characters/fen-daratic|Fen Daratic]]**: The corrupt geologist whose stolen data made the operation possible. Dasha doesn't know he exists.
- **Nuilean Intelligence (NIA)**: The cutout who recruited her reports to NIA's Ludrion station in Bastion Sol. Dasha is an asset, not an agent — she's being managed, not trusted.
