# Helium-3 & Fusion

Helium-3 is the most strategically important resource in the Abeceus system.

## Why It Matters

Helium-3 is required for **aneutronic fusion**, which releases energy as charged particles rather than neutrons.

### Advantages Over Neutronic Fusion

| Neutronic | Aneutronic (He-3) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Large shielding mass required | Magnetic fields substitute for mass |
| Heat engine conversion (turbines) | Direct current capture (no conversion loss) |
| Larger, heavier | Smaller, lighter, more efficient |

### The Tradeoff

Aneutronic reactors require more powerful magnetic containment due to the much higher temperatures needed. This makes them more expensive, but not prohibitively so.

## Result: High Power-to-Weight Ratio

Aneutronic reactors are ideal for powering spacecraft propulsion systems, yielding efficient, high-performance vessels.

## Sources

### Mesulea (Dominant)
- Best source in the system
- High amounts and concentrations in the atmosphere
- Even higher concentrations in storm systems
- See: [[locations/mesulea/aeolus-station|Aeolus Station]]

### Nuilea (Limited)
- Low concentrations
- High surface gravity makes atmospheric mining extremely difficult
- Uses extreme measures including slave labor
- See: [[projects/bluespire|Project BLUESPIRE]]

### Ludrion
- Low concentrations (embedded by solar wind)
- Currently being industrialized by Nuilea

## Geopolitical Consequences

Mesulea's de facto monopoly on helium-3 gives them major economic and military leverage over the entire system, especially [[factions/nuilea|Nuilea]].
