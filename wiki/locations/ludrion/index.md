# Ludrion

The innermost planet. Its proximity to Abeceus caused the crust to boil away over eons, leaving the metal-rich mantle and core exposed.

## Characteristics

- Metal-rich surface
- Historically uneconomical for mining due to distance from Mesulea and Nuilea
- Low helium-3 concentrations (embedded by solar wind)

## Industrialization

Nuilea has begun industrializing Ludrion as part of the [[projects/janus|Janus II Project]]. The planet's position makes it ideal for:
- Receiving beamed power from a future Dyson Swarm
- Constructing satellites for proximal Abecean orbit
