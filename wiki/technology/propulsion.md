# Propulsion

Space travel in the Abeceus system is defined by **high-performance STL** (slower-than-light) propulsion. There is no casual FTL travel within the system.

## Drive Systems

*[Name TBD]* — High-acceleration STL drives

### Characteristics
- Expensive
- Fuel-intensive
- Operationally constrained

### Common Systems
- Nuclear thermal rockets
- Ion thrusters
- Other STL propulsion systems

## Strategic Implications

- Trading barges utilize STL propulsion to ship goods around the system
- Military spacecraft use STL for short-range maneuvering, planetary sieges, and ship-to-ship combat
- The necessity of helium-3 for efficient space travel makes it a strategic resource

## Interstellar Travel

The only known route to another star system is the [[projects/oziri-corridor|Oziri Corridor]]—a wormhole route controlled by the [[factions/hespers|Hespers]].
