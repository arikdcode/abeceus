# Atruna

The remarkably Earth-like world that attracted the original colonists a millennium ago.

## Planetary Characteristics

- Temperate climate
- Breathable O₂/Ar atmosphere
- Strong magnetic field
- Oceans and continents
- 0.98 g surface gravity
- Wild fauna

## Background

The modern inhabitants of the wider Abecean system are descended from the original colonists of Atruna. After being cut off from Earth, Atruna retained scientific understanding in their databanks, but with a low population and no access to Earth's vast pool of expertise, they had to rebuild engineering and industrial capability from scratch. It took many centuries to match what Earth had before contact was lost.

## Political Status

- Lost position as primary power centuries ago
- Maintains close diplomatic ties with former colonies (Mesulea, Nuilea)
- Considered **neutral ground** for ceremonies and diplomacy
- Mesulean and Nuilean governments integrate Atrunean ceremonial functions

## Notable Locations

### [[atruna/azure-reach|Azure Reach Resort]]

Once the premier diplomatic resort in the system, now a permanent military quarantine zone following a catastrophic bioweapon incident.

**Official Story:** An Oziri terrorist attack killed all 5,800 people inside. There were no survivors. The site remains sealed due to environmental contamination.

**The Truth:** A rogue AIA cell developed an incomplete mind-control pathogen that was released by a fanatical operative after the program was shut down. Everyone inside was infected - but they didn't die. They became violently insane while the pathogen dramatically slowed their aging. The ~3,800 survivors remain alive after seven decades, sustained by secret supply drops while being studied for their **anti-aging properties**.

The cover-up framed Oziri for the massacre, providing the moral outrage that triggered the [[setting/oziri-conflict|Oziri Conflict]] - the most devastating war in Abecean history. Emperor Tashen IV, who had moral qualms about the frame job, died under suspicious circumstances. His son, the current Emperor, is complicit.

A secret Immortality Consortium of elites from across the system now collaborates on anti-aging research. **Valen Morrec**, the operative who released the pathogen, survived his own infection and now rules the infected as their king. He's been tunneling out for decades and has made contact with Oziri pirates. Within the next year or two, he may escape with evidence that could expose everything - and set the system on fire.
