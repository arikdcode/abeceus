# Asteroid Belt & Clusters

The asteroid belt lies between [[locations/atruna/index|Atruna]] and [[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulea]], along with several O'Neill cylinder clusters throughout Abecean space.

## The Belt

The asteroid belt contains millions of asteroids, including several major bodies. It has historically been:
- A mining region for various corporations
- A hiding place for pirates before they acquired long-range drives
- Difficult to police due to sheer number of asteroids

## O'Neill Clusters

Groups of giant cylindrical habitats with rotationally-induced artificial gravity, large enough to sustain a microclimate.

### Typical Specifications
- **Average size**: 8 km diameter × 40 km long
- **Layout**: Habitation and green space along inner wall, lit axle down center
- **Variants**: "Honeycomb" cylinders replace open sky with more living/industrial space

### Why People Live Here
- Controlled environments
- Religious community
- Freedom from major powers
- Individual cylinders tend toward uniform culture; clusters are more diverse

## Notable Clusters

### Belt Cluster
The innermost middle cluster. Freedom-loving miners who trade with the middle system. Most cosmopolitan—foreign ships frequently dock here.

- [[locations/belt/alucorp-station|Alucorp Station]] — Metropolitan center, founded by [[organizations/corporations/alucorp|Alucorp]]
- [[locations/belt/tian-cylinder|Tiān Cylinder]] — Chinese cultural heritage

### Academy Cluster
- [[locations/belt/academy-cluster|Academy Cluster]] — Space-based university *(canon status TBD)*

### Other Potential Clusters
- Religious cluster
- Harmony cluster (obsessed with perfect arrangement)
