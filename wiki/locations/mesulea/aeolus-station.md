# Aeolus Station

The largest and most famous of [[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulea's]] atmospheric mining ports, stationed near the edge of **Magna Fons** (colloquially "The Fountain")—the largest surface storm on Mesulea.

## The Fountain

Helium-3 density increases by several orders of magnitude in the storms in Mesulea's upper atmosphere. A rich layer of liquid helium-3 exists several hundreds of kilometers below the 1 bar boundary (the "surface"). The vortices at the center of storms sometimes penetrate to this layer and pull large amounts of helium-3 up to the thermosphere.

Aeolus Station, along with numerous other stations, rests on the edge of The Fountain. Caught in the angular winds of the storm's edge, the station **orbits the storm epicenter**.

## Physical Form

Hundreds of permanent mining stations exist on Mesulea, the largest being Aeolus Station.

### Buoyancy & Propulsion
- Stations are kept aloft by **hydrogen balloons**
- Maneuver in the atmosphere with **chemical thrusters**
- Built to flex—assumed to be struck by turbulence events that would destroy conventional orbital habitats

### Facilities
Stations serve as ports for:
- Worker shuttles
- Gas mining aircraft
- Helium-3 container ships

They also operate:
- Intermediary helium-3 warehouses
- Helium-3 refineries

## Helium-3 Mining Process

### Collection
Helium-3 is mined from storms by **aircraft**:
1. Aircraft fly through the storm searching for gas patches with high helium-3 concentration
2. They pull in the gas
3. Gas is taken back to the station

### Processing
1. Gas is deposited into tanks in the station's warehouse
2. Goes through a **filtration process**

### Transport
When the station is fully laden:
1. A **helium-3 container ship** takes the fuel to the **Helium-3 Orbital Complex**
2. Launches must be scheduled precisely to:
   - Make rendezvous with the Complex in orbit
   - Minimize the number of launches
   - Minimize the time warehouses are full
3. From the Complex, helium-3 is taken to market

## Population

**113,483 inhabitants**

### Workforce
The majority are workers and administrators who work on the station in shifts of **1 month on, 2 weeks off**.

### Services
The rest tend to work for or own businesses in the market district, providing amenities to the workers.

## Life on Aeolus

### Social Hierarchy
- **Pilots**: Celebrities and liabilities
- **Techs**: Keep the station alive; resent everyone
- **Admin/Security**: Act like a state within a state
- **Service workers**: Food, sanitation, medical—underpaid and indispensable

### Environment
Aeolus is loud, vibrating, cramped, and chemically clean in all the wrong places:
- Air smells like polymer, disinfectant, and hot metal
- Every corridor has emergency signage for pressure loss, toxic exposure, and "storm surge conditions"

### Shift Culture
Brutal: sleep is scheduled around **storm windows**, not human needs.

## Hazards (Routine)

These are not exceptional events—they are normal operating conditions:

- **Turbulence spikes**: Sudden events that throw unsecured bodies into bulkheads
- **Pressure cycling**: Micro-leaks become chronic maintenance battles
- **Electrical events**: Lightning and induced currents force intermittent blackout protocols
- **Radiation/particle storms**: Require comms/sensor "quiet" periods

## Rumors

Aeolus is a natural cover for anything requiring isolation and plausible deniability ("storm damage" explains many anomalies).

Persistent rumor classes (unconfirmed):
- **Anomalous helium signatures** that behave "too well" compared to expected isotopic performance
- Whispers of restricted sampling runs **below standard safety depth**
- A quiet program that treats The Fountain as more than just an industrial resource
