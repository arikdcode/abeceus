# Miezo

The capital moon of the Mesulean Lunar Empire, second largest of Mesulea's 113 moons.

## Geography

- Tidally locked with Mesulea
- **Inward hemisphere**: Calcium carbonates, limestone cave networks (colonized)
- **Outward hemisphere**: Sulfuric plains, mining operations

## Settlement

Early settlers sealed off the large limestone cave networks and used them for shelters. The soft bedrock allowed efficient excavation and expansion over centuries.

- Only 17% of population lives above ground
- Largest city: **Karo** (capital buildings)

## Minos Crater

On the outward hemisphere lies the massive [[locations/mesulea/minos-crater|Minos Crater]]—a sealed atmospheric basin that is effectively opaque to scanning, rumored to host classified facilities.
