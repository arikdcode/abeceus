# The Vey

**Human exonym**: *The Vey* (degraded Atrunan linguistics tag; original self-designation unrecoverable)

Builders of [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri's]] planetary shell and the ancient **transit lattice** that modern humans only partially exploit.

The Vey are not mystics or "space gods." They are a civilization whose power came from **infrastructure**: anchors, containment systems, and protocol-locked networks designed to outlast political cycles by orders of magnitude.

## Core Thesis

The Vey believed that **constraint is safety**.

They built systems that reduce degrees of freedom:
- Travel allowed only where it is *stabilized*
- Access granted only where it is *compliant*
- Catastrophes kept *local* through hard boundaries

Oziri is a **node** in that philosophy: anchor + containment + hardening.

## Biology (Inferred)

### Probable Origin Environment
Cold, high-pressure world (thick atmosphere and/or subsurface ocean under ice).

**Implications**:
- Comfort with pressure and stratified environments
- Cultural obsession with containment and long-duration control

### Body Plan (Non-Humanoid)
- Radial, semi-soft organism with internal structural spars
- Manipulation optimized for fluids and flexible tools
- Primary senses: chemistry, pressure/vibration, broad-spectrum EM field perception

### Mind Style
- Excellent at long-horizon planning and failure analysis
- Less emphasis on improvisation and rapid adaptation
- Strong aversion to unbounded novelty

## Culture and Values

### Three Inferred Axioms
1. **Boundaries create meaning**
2. **Stability enables growth**
3. **Uncontained novelty is contamination**

### The Conservancies
The Vey organized into administrative lineages responsible for infrastructure classes:
- Anchor maintenance
- Transit governance
- Habitat regulation
- Deep resource extraction
- Containment and "hygiene" systems

Status correlated with **reliability over centuries**, not charisma.

## Technology Philosophy

### "Unfair Engineering"
A stacked competence, not one magic invention:
- Extreme materials science (atomically regular alloys)
- Autonomous maintenance for geological timescales
- Precision field control
- **Protocol-locked infrastructure**: systems that won't function outside defined constraints

### The Transit Lattice
The Vey built (or perfected) a transit lattice:
- Wormhole-like transits that only stabilize **near engineered anchors**
- Travel behaves like a rail network, not personal vehicles
- Governance encoded into geometry and compliance rules

## Oziri as a Vey Node

The planetary shell does three things:
1. **Anchor/stability cage** — Creates boundary conditions for lattice endpoints
2. **Containment and hygiene** — Filters biological, radiological, and informational hazards
3. **Hardening** — Survives extreme assault to prevent node failure

## Why They're Gone (Ambiguous)

Human scholarship offers three compatible hypotheses:

**Dial A: The Retreat** — After a lattice-era accident, the Vey retracted, locked down nodes, and reduced presence intentionally.

**Dial B: The Schism** — Conservancies split over doctrine; conflict was protocol warfare (access changes, network orphaning, anchor bricking).

**Dial C: The Slow Death** — No apocalypse, just time. Caution outpaced innovation; population dwindled; maintenance systems continued because they were designed to.

## Integration with Current Canon

- Oziri's shell perfection aligns with redundancy-obsessed civilization
- Corridor endpoint near Oziri aligns with anchors as required boundary conditions
- Modern "FTL" (Hesper wormholes) is **compatibility-layer use** of an ancient lattice, not independent mastery
