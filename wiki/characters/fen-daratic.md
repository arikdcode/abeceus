## Background

Fen has spent twenty-five years in the Mesulean Geological Survey Bureau, the agency responsible for mapping and cataloging Ludrion's subsurface mineral resources. He's good at his job — methodical, detail-oriented, patient with data. He rose steadily through the ranks to senior surveyor, responsible for analyzing deep seismic data from the Lumina-Aurelius trunk line and surrounding territories.

He was never going to be promoted further. The Bureau's leadership positions go to people with political connections and MLE loyalty credentials. Fen has neither. He's a career technician in a system that rewards pedigree. At 51, he's at the ceiling of what his career will ever be, and he knows it.

## Personality

Outwardly, Fen is unremarkable. Quiet, professional, does his work. Colleagues describe him as "reliable" and "not much fun at parties." He lives alone in a modest Lumina apartment, eats at the same three restaurants, and reads geological journals in his spare time. He's the kind of person you forget five minutes after meeting him.

Underneath that surface is a man who has spent two decades watching less talented people advance past him, who has calculated his pension to the credit and found it wanting, and who harbors a deep, quiet resentment toward the system that used his expertise without ever rewarding it. He's not ideological — he doesn't hate Mesulea or love Nuilea. He's transactional. When the opportunity presented itself, he took it.

## The Discovery

Approximately three years ago, while reviewing deep seismic data from a routine survey along the Lumina-Aurelius corridor, Fen noticed anomalous acoustic reflections originating from approximately 12 kilometers below the territorial boundary zone. The reflections suggested a dense, crystalline formation — unusual for deep basalt at that depth.

The readings were faint and partially obscured by the surrounding rock structure. From the Lumina-Aurelius tunnel's angle, the data was inconclusive — suggestive, but not definitive. In normal procedure, Fen would have flagged it for follow-up deep prospecting, which would have been queued, budgeted, and eventually investigated — probably in two to five years, if ever.

Fen didn't file the report.

Instead, he spent several months running his own analysis on the data, using Bureau equipment during off-hours. He confirmed — to his own satisfaction — that the anomaly was consistent with a significant mineral deposit of unusual composition. He couldn't identify the material from seismic data alone, but he knew it was large, it was dense, and it was deep.

## The Betrayal

Fen had a contact. A Nuilean trade representative he'd met at a geological conference in Aurelius Hub years earlier — the kind of person who buys drinks for survey technicians and remembers their names. The kind of person who is almost certainly NIA.

Fen approached the contact. The negotiation was brief and professional. Fen provided the raw seismic data, his analysis, and the exact coordinates of the anomaly. In return, he received a sum large enough to retire comfortably — deposited in an Atrunean financial institution under an alias, beyond Mesulean oversight.

Nuilea's follow-up surveys from the Sol-Aurelius trunk confirmed the deposit from a different angle. Between Fen's stolen data and their own readings, they triangulated the location precisely: a massive concentration of naturally occurring superconductor crystal at ~12km depth, straddling the Nuilean-Mesulean boundary with the richest veins extending into Mesulean-claimed subsurface.

## Current Situation

Fen continues to work at the Mesulean Geological Survey Bureau. He goes to work, analyzes data, files reports. Nobody suspects anything. He is meticulous about maintaining his routine.

He is, however, nervous. Not about the money — that's safely hidden. About the data. The anomalous readings still exist in the Bureau's raw archives. He didn't delete them — that would have left a trace. Instead, he buried them: mislabeled in a routine batch of unremarkable survey data, tagged with metadata that makes them unlikely to surface in any standard search. But he can't guarantee that another surveyor won't stumble onto the same anomaly during a future survey pass, or that someone won't pull up old data during a deep-prospecting initiative.

He monitors the Bureau's project queue and publication schedule carefully, watching for any sign that someone else is looking at the boundary zone. So far, nothing. But it's been three years, and every month that passes is another month where he's one keyword search away from exposure.

He has no direct contact with the Nuilean mining operation. He sold data, not loyalty. He doesn't know about Dasha Vorn or the bore shaft or the overnight vibrations. He just knows that somewhere under the boundary, Nuilea is presumably doing something with the information he sold them. He tries not to think about it.

## What Makes Him Interesting

- He's the origin point of the entire conspiracy. Without his data, Nuilea never finds the deposit.
- He's still in place, still working at the Bureau, still watching. He's a ticking time bomb — if he's found out, the whole operation unravels.
- He's not a villain. He's a tired, underpaid career technician who saw an opportunity and took it. His motivation is painfully ordinary: money and resentment.
- He's an intelligence asset who doesn't act like one. No dead drops, no coded messages. He sold one piece of data three years ago and has been sitting on his nerves ever since.
- If the PCs somehow trace the conspiracy back to its origin, Fen is the thread. And he's terrified enough to talk — or desperate enough to run.

## Connections

- **Nuilean Intelligence (NIA)**: His original contact has since rotated out of Ludrion. Fen has no current handler and no way to contact NIA directly. He's a spent asset as far as they're concerned — useful once, now to be left alone.
- **[[characters/tomas-kriel|Tomás Kriel]]**: No direct connection. They might have crossed paths in Aurelius Hub, but Fen doesn't frequent bars and Tomás wouldn't remember him.
- **[[characters/dasha-vorn|Dasha Vorn]]**: No connection. Fen doesn't know who is working the operation his data enabled.
- **Mesulean Geological Survey Bureau**: His employer. They trust him. He's been there twenty-five years.
