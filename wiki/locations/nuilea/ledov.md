# Ledov

A frozen moon in the [[locations/nuilea/index|Nuilean]] system with massive water ice deposits. Critical for life support and propellant supply across Nuilean space.

## Overview

Ledov exists as a settlement because water is both life and fuel. Ice is cracked into hydrogen (reaction mass for propulsion) and oxygen (life support). Every ship, every station, every habitat in the Nuilean system depends on water—and Ledov supplies it at industrial scale.

**Population**: ~15 million

## Operations

### Ice Mining

Massive surface and subsurface extraction operations. Automated boring machines cut into ice sheets, conveyor systems move material to processing plants, and water is shipped across the system in bulk carriers.

### Processing

Ice is processed into:
- **Purified water**: For drinking, agriculture, and industrial use
- **Hydrogen**: Primary reaction mass for spacecraft propulsion
- **Oxygen**: Life support systems

### Distribution

Ledov operates a fleet of ice haulers—unglamorous bulk carriers that keep the Nuilean system running. Water shipments are as routine as fuel deliveries, and just as essential.

## Character

Frozen surface, underground mining complexes, processing plants wreathed in steam and vapor. Workers live in heated habitats clustered around industrial sites. Outside is lethal cold; inside is cramped warmth.

Ledov has a blue-collar culture. Ice miners are proud of their essential work but aware they're far from the glamour of the capital or the drama of Poena Station.

## Strategic Significance

Water independence is often overlooked, but it's fundamental. Ledov ensures Nuilea doesn't depend on imported water—another resource that could be weaponized by rivals.
