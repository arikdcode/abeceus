# Miezo

The capital moon of the [[polities/mesulea|Mesulean Lunar Empire]], second largest of [[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulea's]] 113 moons. Tidally locked with Mesulea.

## Geography

### Inward Hemisphere (Mesulea-facing)
- Abundant in **calcium carbonates**
- Large **limestone cave networks** colonized by early settlers
- The soft limestone bedrock can be efficiently excavated, allowing significant expansion over centuries

### Outward Hemisphere
- Covered in large **sulfuric plains**
- Mostly populated by **sulfur dune mining operations**
- Otherwise devoid of habitats

## Settlement

Early settlers sealed off the large limestone cave networks and used them for shelters. As the industrial capability of the MLE improved, surface residential buildings became cheaper and more popular.

**Population Distribution:**
- Only **17%** of Miezo's population lives above ground
- The majority live in the expanded underground cave networks

## Karo

The largest city on Miezo is **Karo**, located on the inward hemisphere. This is where the **capital buildings** of the Mesulean Lunar Empire reside.

## Minos Crater

On the outward hemisphere, in the middle of the sulfur dunes, lies the massive [[locations/mesulea/minos-crater|Minos Crater]].

### Characteristics
- Crater rim is so high that there is **no interaction** between the atmosphere inside and outside the crater
- Interior atmosphere composed of **dense poisonous gas**
- Impossible to get real-time imaging through
- Surface topography has been mapped, but real-time observation is impractical

### Significance
Rumored to host a [[polities/mesulea|Mesulean]] black-site run by a compartmented "dark bureaucracy."
