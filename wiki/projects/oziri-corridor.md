# The Oziri Corridor

The common Abecean name for the Hespen wormhole route into Abeceus space. The corridor **must stabilize near Oziri**, placing its mouth within Oziri's effective fast-strike reach.

This single constraint reshapes the entire system's geopolitics.

## Why Near Oziri?

The corridor endpoint requires specific spacetime geometry that exists only in Oziri's vicinity. This is not coincidence - it is architecture.

Deep within Oziri lies the **[[technology/vey-anchor|Vey Anchor]]**: a contained primordial singularity modified by the [[species/vey|Vey]] into a "regulated naked singularity." The exposed spacetime effects create precise boundary conditions that the ancient transit lattice recognizes as a valid endpoint.

In simple terms: Oziri is a station on a rail network the Vey built millions of years ago. The Hespers who use the corridor are traveling on infrastructure they didn't create. The corridor *must* connect near Oziri because that's where the socket is.

**Consequence**: Oziri gets first contact by default.

## The Window

The corridor is usable only during a limited period:
- Predictable enough to schedule around
- Not so predictable that it's risk-free
- When open: system's top strategic priority
- When closed: return to "normal" balance of power

## Oziri's Leverage: Proximity Denial

The corridor mouth lies within range where Oziri's forces can impose continuous attrition on any fleet attempting to loiter nearby.

Abecean powers can mass forces, but:
- Permanent posture near Oziri carries unacceptable losses
- "Solving Oziri" requires full-scale campaign (blockade + bombardment + invasion)
- They tried this once and failed

Result: Oziri enjoys a de facto **proximity veto** over corridor access.

## The Corridor Truce

During the window, the system enters an informal truce:
- Oziri doesn't prey on Hespen shipping
- Major powers avoid open warfare near the corridor mouth
- Everyone maneuvers through proxies, contracts, and bribery

The truce is practical, not moral: everyone benefits from trade, and violence risks collapsing the opportunity.

## Mesulea–Oziri Arrangement

The [[polities/hespers|Hespers]] strongly value helium-3. Mesulea is the only abundant supplier. A plausible corridor-era arrangement:
- Oziri permits Mesulean bulk He-3 shipments through
- In exchange for fees and concessions
- Rivalry resumes outside truce windows

Openly cynical and widely resented, but stable.

## Effects on Others

| Faction | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Atruna** | Leverages diplomacy as "civilized mediator" |
| **Nuilea** | Opportunity and humiliation; pursues independence programs |
| **Freeholds** | Essential as financiers and neutral facilitators |
| **Belt/Clusters** | Hiring booms, security contracts, shipping surges |
