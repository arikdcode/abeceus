# Ship Classes

Standard spacecraft classifications in the Abeceus system.

## Combat Vessels

| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| Fighter | Small single-pilot combat craft |
| PT Boat | Small patrol/scouting vessels |
| Corvette | Light multi-role warship |
| Frigate | Escort and patrol |
| Destroyer | Fleet screening and anti-fighter |
| Cruiser | Main battle line |
| Battleship | Heavy combat |
| Dreadnought | Capital ship, fleet centerpiece |
| Carrier | Fighter deployment platform |

## Notes

The [[military/mesulea|Mesulean Imperial Navy]] organizes its peacetime fleet into 12 groups, each formed around a single dreadnought.

## Design Philosophies

- [[military/mesulea|Mesulean ships]]: Elegant, fuel-rich, optimized
- [[military/nuilea|Nuilean ships]]: Bulk, shielding, redundancy ("dirty fusion ships")
