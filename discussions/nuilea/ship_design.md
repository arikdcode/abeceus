# Nuilean Ship Design

Nuilean shipbuilding has a recognizable philosophy: **bulk, shielding, redundancy, and maintainability**.

Foreign engineers describe Nuilean hulls as *“dirty fusion ships”* because Nuilea often accepts higher radiation budgets, heavier shielding, and less elegant reactor cycles in exchange for operational autonomy.

## Why Nuilean ships look different

### Helium-3 constraint
- Aneutronic fusion cycles that favor helium-3 are strategically constrained by supply.
- Nuilea therefore leans on reactor cycles that are:
  - easier to fuel domestically,
  - but more neutron-heavy or otherwise harsher on components.

### Operational consequence
- More shielding mass
- More heat management hardware
- More replaceable internal modules
- Lower elegance, higher ruggedness

Nuilean ships are often **slower to build** but **harder to kill politically**: they can keep running under harsh conditions and degraded supply.

## Typical design traits

- **Brutalist massing:** thicker structural members, simple stress paths, fewer “clever” lightweight sections
- **Overbuilt radiators:** large, segmented, replaceable panels
- **Modular reactor bays:** designed for hot swaps and emergency isolation
- **Service-first interiors:** corridors, crane points, standardized connectors
- **Dirty exhaust management:** more aggressive plume profiles, more detectable signatures, less stealth emphasis

## Doctrine tie-ins

Nuilean ship design aligns with their strategy:
- Survive long logistics lines
- Operate under comms/sensor disruption
- Accept inefficient energy cycles if it buys fuel independence
- Leverage [[Mazer Relay Network]] support when available to reduce onboard fuel expenditure

## Cultural note

Nuilean crews often see Mesulean ships as “spoiled”: elegant, fuel-rich, optimized for a world where the market always provides.
Mesulean crews often see Nuilean ships as “dangerous junk”: too hot, too loud, too angry.

Both stereotypes are wrong in useful ways.
