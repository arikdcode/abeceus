# Nuilea

A rising great power with a scarcity-forged identity.

## State Identity

> *"We will not be strangled by someone else's resource."*

Nuilean strategy is not "outbuilding" Mesulea in a symmetric race. It is **breaking the terms of dependence** through targeted programs, asymmetry, and political ruthlessness.

## Strategic Posture

### What Nuilea Wants
- Independence from Mesulean helium-3 coercion
- A credible deterrent posture
- Control over at least one system-level chokepoint

### What Nuilea Fears
- A future where Mesulea dictates fleet readiness through fuel markets
- Diplomatic isolation
- Humiliating concessions during corridor windows

## Doctrine: Industrial Militarism

- Industry as a military domain (fuel, power, logistics are weapons)
- Security services embedded in major infrastructure
- Large programs used as both capability and political theater

Nuilean planners expect conflict to be decided by:
- Who sustains operational tempo under constraints
- Who can deny mobility and refuel cycles
- Who survives political shocks

## Core Programs

- [[technology/mazer-relay-network|Mazer Relay Network (MRN)]] — Beamed power infrastructure
- [[projects/bluespire|Project BLUESPIRE]] — Induced atmospheric harvesting
- [[projects/janus|Project Janus II]] — Compartmented long-horizon program

## Tone

Nuilea is not a monolithic dystopia:
- Most citizens live ordinary lives in a stable, functioning state
- Dark edges exist in compartmented programs and frontier labor regimes
- Public politics is real: budgets, scandals, veterans, unions, corporate influence
