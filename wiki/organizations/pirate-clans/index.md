## The Pirate Compact

All clans are signatories to the **Pirate Compact**, an agreement enforced by the [[polities/oziri-council|Oziri Council]] that:

1. **Limits raiding** — No single target hit too often or too hard
2. **Protects neutral ground** — Violence forbidden in commercial/residential areas
3. **Collective enforcement** — Violators face combined action from all clans

The Compact transformed pirates from escalating menace to "persistent nuisance" that the inner system tolerates.
