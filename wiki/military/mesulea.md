# Mesulean Military

The dominant conventional military force in the Abeceus system.

## Branches

- **Mesulean Imperial Navy**
- **Mesulean Imperial Marines**

## Fleet Organization (Peacetime)

The bulk of the navy is divided into **12 groups**, each formed around a single **dreadnought**.

At any given time:
- Half the fleet patrols the wider system
- Half is stationed in Mesulean space

## Early Warning

A constellation of satellites exists at a defined radius around Mesulea:
- Multiple radar technologies
- Shorter-ranged visual systems for detecting stealth ships

## Strategic Advantages

- Helium-3 abundance enables high-performance aneutronic reactors
- Lighter, more efficient ships
- Superior power-to-weight ratios
- Better operational range and tempo
