# Ludrion

The innermost planet of the Abeceus system. Proximity to the sun has boiled away the crust over eons, leaving a scorched, metal-rich mantle and core exposed to the vacuum.

## Characteristics

- **Surface**: A chaotic, high-temperature wasteland of exposed heavy metals, cooling magma veins, and impact-shattered mantle rock.
- **Atmosphere**: None (vacuum).
- **Environment**: Extreme radiation and thermal stress. Surface operations require heavy shielding and active cooling.
- **Resource Profile**: Abundant in heavy metals (iron, nickel, iridium, gold, platinum) and rare earth elements. Historically too remote to mine efficiently, but recent technological shifts have made it the system's premier industrial frontier.
- **Uranium Deposits**: Unlike the outer worlds, Ludrion contains massive, accessible deposits of uranium within its exposed mantle.

## Energy & Fission

On Ludrion, **fission is the dominant energy source** for land-based industry. While Helium-3 fusion is the system-wide standard for spacecraft, the cost of shipping fuel from the gas giants makes fusion less economical for stationary planetary facilities.

- **Land-Based Fission**: Industrial-scale fission reactors power the op-centers and extraction pits. The bulk and weight of fission hardware are not a hindrance for stationary surface or subterranean sites.
- **Spaceborne Fusion**: Spacefaring craft docking at Ludrion almost exclusively use fusion (either Nuilean tritium or Mesulean He-3) because the vastly superior energy density and delta-v are worth the fuel-shipping costs.
- **Radiation Context**: Abeceus (the sun) already floods Ludrion with intense radiation. Modern shielding technology is highly advanced and treats radiation as a routine environmental constant. However, the sheer volume of concentrated radioactive waste produced by planet-wide fission requires a dedicated industrial solution.

## Centralized Fission Waste Repository (CFWR)

To minimize infrastructure costs and environmental impact, all factions on Ludrion share a single nuclear waste storage facility.

- **Management**: The facility is jointly managed by the Ludrion Accord signatories, but **Atruna** provides the majority of the staff and administrative oversight, leveraging their status as a neutral power to ensure fair access and safety standards.
- **Structure**: A massive, deep-crust containment complex located in a tectonically stable "cold zone." It is designed to handle industrial-grade volumes of high-level waste for centuries.
- **Significance**: As the only legal dumping ground for Ludrion's fission economy, the CFWR is a critical chokepoint. While nominally neutral, it is one of the most heavily monitored and politically sensitive sites on the planet.

## The Ludrion Accords (Political Landscape)

Ludrion is a de facto **neutral industrial zone**. Because no single power can maintain a total blockade so close to the sun, and the extraction costs are so high, the major powers have established an uneasy cooperation.

Despite the "neutral" label, both **Nuilea** and **Mesulea** maintain **sizeable military presences** on the planet to protect their vast investments and project power.

| Faction | Presence | Industrial Profile |
|---------|----------|--------------------|
| **[[factions/nuilea|Nuilea]]** | Large | Fully diversified; focus on high-volume extraction & heavy foundries; [[projects/janus|Janus II]] (Secretive). |
| **[[factions/mesulea|Mesulea]]** | Large | Fully diversified; focus on advanced materials & precision refining; MLE Naval consulate & security. |
| **[[factions/atruna|Atruna]]** | Medium | Specialized; focus on logistical services, finance, & high-value trade; notable industrial gaps. |
| **[[factions/freeholds|Freeholds]]** | Minor | Niche; independent small-scale extraction & salvage; significant reliance on major power infrastructure. |
| **[[factions/oziri-council|Oziri]]** | Unofficial | Shadow ops; black market siphoning; operations typically **masquerade** as other factions or rogue contractors. |

## Industrial Breadth

Both **Nuilea** and **Mesulea** operate at a scale that precludes major industrial gaps. Both powers extract and process massive quantities of basic raw materials (iron, nickel, silicates) while maintaining high-end precision manufacturing capabilities. The distinction is primarily a matter of degree:

- **Nuilean operations** lean toward **mass-industrial output** and brute-force extraction, prioritizing volume and throughput.
- **Mesulean operations** lean toward **precision engineering** and the development of exotic alloys, leveraging their superior solar-focusing technology.

Atruna, the Freeholds, and Oziri lack this total vertical integration on Ludrion and must focus on specific niches or logistical gaps left by the two giants.

## Operational Centers (Op-Centers)

Unlike extraction outposts, these are fully realized **subterranean cities**. They serve as the administrative, logistics, and social hubs for their respective factions. The three major hubs are positioned across Ludrion's surface in a strategic triangle configuration.

### Geographic Layout & Underground Railway

The three op-centers are connected by a massive **underground rail network**, critical to Ludrion's economy:

- **Bastion Sol (Nuilea)** ↔ **Aurelius Hub (Atruna)**: High-traffic rail line for ore exchange and indirect trade.
- **Lumina (Mesulea)** ↔ **Aurelius Hub (Atruna)**: High-traffic rail line for ore exchange and indirect trade.
- **Bastion Sol ↔ Lumina**: **No direct connection**. Nuilea and Mesulea refuse to build a direct link due to mutual distrust.

**Result**: Nearly all trade between the two superpowers flows through **Aurelius Hub**, making Atruna extraordinarily wealthy from transit fees, exchange services, and arbitrage.

---

### 1. Bastion Sol (Nuilea)

The largest and most industrial of the op-centers. Bastion Sol is a massive, heavily armored subterranean complex built into a deep equatorial canyon. It is the heart of Nuilea's Ludrion operations and the secret testing ground for [[projects/janus|Janus II]].

- **Population**: ~950,000 permanent residents (overwhelmingly Nuilean nationals; highly restricted foreign worker permits)
- **Character**: Rigid, military-industrial, utilitarian. Everything is built to withstand both environmental extremes and potential military assault.
- **Key Features**:
  - Massive smelting foundries processing thousands of tons per hour
  - **Nuilean Marine garrison** (brigade-strength, heavily equipped)
  - Restricted "Research Annexes" buried deep below the main city—off-limits to foreign observers and protected by counter-intelligence teams
  - Sprawling worker dormitories and communal mess halls
  - Multiple spaceport tiers handling bulk freighters
- **Atmosphere**: The smell of ozone and heated metal; constant vibration from heavy machinery; the hum of fission reactors; military discipline in public spaces.
- **Security**: Nuilean Intelligence Agency (NIA) maintains a permanent station. Surveillance is omnipresent. Foreign nationals require escorts in most districts.

### 2. Lumina (Mesulea)

Mesulea's primary hub, known for its extensive use of giant orbital mirror arrays to beam concentrated solar power down to high-precision refineries. Lumina is more "elegant" than its Nuilean counterpart, reflecting Mesulean architectural pride and technological sophistication.

- **Population**: ~720,000 permanent residents (selective immigration; emphasis on technical expertise and MLE loyalty)
- **Character**: Professional, high-tech, elitist. Clean lines, controlled environments, and an almost clinical efficiency.
- **Key Features**:
  - The **"Glass Spires"**: shielded observation decks where executives and diplomats conduct high-level negotiations with a view of the sun-scorched surface
  - The system's most advanced **materials science laboratories**, developing exotic alloys and thermal-resistant composites
  - **Mesulean Naval consulate and security detachment** (battalion-strength, with orbital support assets)
  - Automated refineries and precision manufacturing lines
  - A "Garden Sector" (climate-controlled biosphere for MLE elite—rare vegetation and flowing water, ostentatious in a world of vacuum and heat)
- **Atmosphere**: Clean, climate-controlled, eerily quiet. The only sounds are the hum of ventilation and the occasional chime of automated systems. Workers speak in hushed tones.
- **Security**: Mesulean Internal Security (MIS) runs strict clearance protocols. Even allied foreign nationals are restricted to designated "diplomatic corridors."

### 3. Aurelius Hub (Atruna)

The **"Gateway to Ludrion"** and the most cosmopolitan of the three hubs. While it handles massive amounts of ore, Aurelius is primarily a **service city**—the financial, logistical, and entertainment capital of the planet. It is where workers from all factions go to spend their credits, where deals are struck, and where the two superpowers conduct indirect trade.

- **Population**: ~1.8 million permanent residents (the most diverse population on Ludrion; includes Atruneans, Freeholders, transient workers from all powers, and undocumented migrants)
- **Character**: Capitalist, neon-lit, high-energy. A chaotic blend of industrial grit and corporate glitz.
- **Key Features**:
  - **The "Gilded Maw"**: The system's largest ore-exchange floor, where Nuilean and Mesulean ore is traded, refined, and re-sold. Fortunes are made and lost hourly.
  - High-end casinos, hotels, and entertainment districts catering to wealthy executives and off-duty workers
  - The **"Freehold Quarter"**: A leased district where independent Freehold miners and contractors operate warehouses, repair shops, and bunkhouses
  - **The Rail Nexus**: The central hub where all underground rail lines converge—a massive, multi-level transit station that never sleeps
  - Atrunan corporate security forces (private contractors, well-armed but officially "non-military")
  - Black market hubs tucked into maintenance tunnels and forgotten storage complexes (Oziri presence strongest here)
- **Atmosphere**: Chaotic, vibrant, expensive. The air smells of recirculated air, street food, and industrial lubricants. Neon signs flicker in a dozen languages. Music spills from bars. The sound of rail cars rumbling below is constant.
- **Security**: Atrunan Corporate Security Consortium (ACSC) maintains order, but they are stretched thin and willing to "overlook" minor infractions in exchange for bribes. Oziri operatives move freely in the lower levels.

## Extraction Network

While the major hubs handle the bulk of administration, there are **dozens of extraction operations** scattered across Ludrion's scorched surface.

- **Nuilea & Mesulea**: Operate scores of distributed sites ranging from automated drone-pits to massive manned complexes.
- **Oziri Presence**: Oziri "ghost-sites" are often tucked away in magnetic dead zones or "attached" to legitimate foreign operations via forged credentials and hijacked logistics.

### Major Sites
Most mining happens at remote outposts that ship raw ore to the Op-Centers via rail or short-range shuttle. Only a few sites are large enough to be self-sufficient.

### The Anvil (Nuilea)
A gargantuan open-pit mine located at the sub-solar point (the point closest to the sun). It extracts massive quantities of iron and nickel.
- **Logistics**: Large enough to host its own heavy-lift spaceport. Nuilean freighters launch directly from The Anvil to the outer system.
- **Hazard**: Extreme thermal stress—mining equipment must be replaced or overhauled every 30 cycles.

### Iron Grasp Crater (Mesulea)
A massive impact basin on the northern pole, rich in rare earth elements and iridium.
- **Logistics**: Operates as a semi-autonomous port. Mesulean "Refinery Ships" often dock directly at the rim to process ore before taking it to Lumina or off-world.
- **Hazard**: High electromagnetic interference—navigation requires inertial sensors only.

### The Vein (Atruna/Freeholds)
A 200km long tectonic rift filled with high-grade gold and platinum deposits. Atruna manages the primary site, but they lease sections of the rift to Freehold mining syndicates.
- **Logistics**: Too unstable for a major port. Ore is moved via a massive automated rail system to **Aurelius Hub** for processing.
- **Shadow Market**: Because of the rift's size, Oziri-linked "ghost-rigs" are frequently caught siphoning ore from unpatrolled sections.

### Sulfur Sea Sinkhole (Joint Venture)
A deep, unstable sinkhole rich in volatile compounds and sulfur salts used in industrial chemistry.
- **Logistics**: A "shuttle-only" site. Small tugs move raw materials to the nearest Op-Center hub.
- **Significance**: One of the few sites where Nuilean and Mesulean contractors work in the same pit, leading to frequent "industrial accidents" and sabotage.
