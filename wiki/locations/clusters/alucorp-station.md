# Alucorp Station

The metropolitan center of the [[locations/clusters/index|Belt Cluster]], founded by [[factions/corporations/alucorp|Alucorp]].

## Location

Positioned at the barycenter of the densest asteroid group in the belt, which contains the 1st, 3rd, and 6th largest asteroids.

## History

The station began as a dock with a small rotating habitation module where ore barges could dock. As operations grew, an O'Neill cylinder was constructed. The dock and cylinder are attached by a central walkway leading from the dock to the center of the cylinder on the clockwise side. The dock does not rotate, so the dockway is coupled to the cylinder with a massive bearing.

Over centuries, new cylinders were constructed nearby by various corporations and spacer unions, while Alucorp Station became the metropolitan center of the Belt Cluster.

## Facilities

- Corporate offices (mining, refining, manufacturing, spacecraft industries)
- Hotels and nightlife for spacers
- [[factions/mesulea|Mesulean]], [[factions/nuilea|Nuilean]], and [[factions/atruna|Atrunean]] consulates

## Significance

A major hub for belt commerce and a common stopping point for ships traveling to and from the asteroid belt. [[characters/hai-jun|Hai Jun]] frequented this station during his early pirate career.
