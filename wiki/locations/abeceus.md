# Abeceus

The unary star of the Abecean System. Similar to Earth's Sun in spectral band and luminosity, but somewhat smaller and less massive.

## Abecean Flares

Abecean flares are **frequent**, emitting large bursts of x-rays into the system.

### Effects on Spacecraft
Spacecraft's vulnerable communications and sensory equipment must be **shielded during these events**, restricting their capabilities.

### Exploitation by Pirates
Flares give pirates a window to:
- Attack
- Board
- Retreat

All before distress calls can be sent. This has made piracy a persistent problem throughout the system's history.

## Strategic Significance

- Primary energy source for the entire system
- Target of [[factions/nuilea|Nuilea's]] [[projects/janus|Janus II Project]]
- Potential site for a future Dyson Swarm to break [[factions/mesulea|Mesulean]] helium-3 hegemony
