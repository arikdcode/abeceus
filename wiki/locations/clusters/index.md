# O'Neill Clusters

Groups of giant cylindrical habitats with rotationally-induced artificial gravity, large enough to sustain a microclimate.

## Typical Specifications

- **Average size**: 8 km diameter × 40 km long
- **Layout**: Habitation and green space along inner wall, lit axle down center
- **Variants**: "Honeycomb" cylinders replace open sky with more living/industrial space

## Why People Live Here

- Controlled environments
- Religious community
- Freedom from major powers
- Individual cylinders tend toward uniform culture; clusters are more diverse

## Notable Clusters

### Belt Cluster
The innermost middle cluster. Freedom-loving miners who trade with the middle system. Most cosmopolitan—foreign ships frequently dock here.

**[[locations/clusters/alucorp-station|Alucorp Station]]**: Founded by [[factions/corporations/alucorp|Alucorp]] at the barycenter of the densest asteroid group. Began as a dock with habitation module, grew into the metropolitan center of the Belt Cluster. Hotels, nightlife, corporate offices, consulates.

**[[locations/clusters/tian-cylinder|Tiān Cylinder]]**: Constructed by the spacer union *Hànzú Láodòng zhě* ("Workers of the Han"). Chinese cultural heritage with evolved social conventions. Run by three prominent families.

### Other Potential Clusters
- Religious cluster
- Harmony cluster (obsessed with perfect arrangement)
- Academy cluster (giant space-based university)
