# Setting Canon, Factions, and the Freeholds

This document captures the current **draft-canon** for the Abeceus setting: tone constraints, core technological assumptions, and the major political actors (including the Oziri governance model and the Freeholds).

---

## Core canon constraints (tone + tech)

### Tone targets
- **Gritty and realistic**, with believable adult economics and geopolitics.
- **Not fully dystopian**: the setting resembles modern life in that stability exists alongside localized brutality and systemic corruption.
- **Mil-sim feel**: logistics, doctrine, budgets, and operational limitations matter.
- **Spy-thriller layer**: secrets exist and can be uncovered, producing high-impact intrigue and mission drivers.

### Technology constraints
- **No broad, casual FTL** as the default state of the Abeceus system.
- Space travel is defined by **high-performance STL**: expensive, fuel-intensive, operationally constrained.
- **Helium-3** is a strategic commodity because it enables lighter/higher-performance reactor and propulsion profiles.
- Advanced infrastructure (beamed power, relays, exotic stations) can exist, but must be:
  - expensive,
  - politically contested,
  - and not so abundant that it breaks the setting’s power structures.

### Secrets constraint
- Secrets and alien artifacts can exist in multiple places.
- They should be **discoverable**, **localized**, and **high-value**.
- They should reshape incentives and create crises, not instantly rewrite the entire economy overnight.

## Major factions (draft list)

### Atruna
- The original colony world and long-standing cultural core.
- Rich and influential through diplomacy, institutions, and legacy authority.
- Militarily significant but not the dominant hegemon compared to the lunar empires.

### Mesulea (Mesulean Lunar Empire)
- The largest great power in conventional military and industrial terms.
- Holds a major strategic advantage through **helium-3 accessibility at scale**.
- Signature setpieces:
  - atmospheric helium-3 mining (e.g., Aeolus Station and storm culture)
  - compartmented dark-state projects (e.g., Minos crater black-site)

### Nuilea
- A rising great power with a scarcity-forged identity.
- Pursues strategic independence from Mesulean helium-3 leverage through:
  - **Mazer Relay Network (MRN)**
  - **Project BLUESPIRE** (induced atmospheric upwelling harvesting)
  - **Project Janus II** (long-horizon, compartmented end-run around dependence)
- “Dirty fusion ships” aesthetic: bulk, redundancy, shielding, maintainability.

### Oziri
- A pirate-founded polity that matured into a functioning criminal nation-state.
- Small in conventional metrics, but strategically hard to coerce due to:
  - extreme defensibility
  - denial-by-attrition dynamics
  - and (later) corridor leverage with the Hespers
- Oziri is practical, profit-driven, and politically complex rather than purely violent.

### The Freeholds
- The innermost major faction (details TBD).
- Exists to prevent all geopolitics from collapsing into a Mesulea vs Nuilea binary.
- Has its own population, doctrine, and military posture, distinct from corporate “neutrality.”

(Additional actors exist: Belt stations, O’Neill clusters, major corporations, intelligence services, etc., but the above are the headline powers.)

## The Freeholds (stub)

**The Freeholds** are a major inner-system faction characterized by:
- **political fragmentation** (multiple freeholds, compacts, or member polities),
- **high civic capacity** (stable institutions, training pipelines, and credible defense),
- and a strategic preference for **neutral leverage** over open domination.

They are not “the Belt,” and not a corporate cartel. They are a real polity with:
- population,
- industrial base,
- and a military capable of defending their interests.

### Why they matter
- They act as a **third pole** in great-power maneuvering.
- They are positioned to become:
  - financiers and insurers of system commerce,
  - neutral arbitration venues,
  - and a balancing weight when Mesulea and Nuilea escalate.

The Freeholds’ detailed culture, geography, and internal politics can be defined later; this stub exists to cement them as canon.

## Oziri as government: piracy evolved into a state

Oziri’s pirate clans are not merely raiders. They function as the **governing class** of a fortified city-world embedded in an alien megastructure.

Oziri’s survival depends on being:
- profitable enough that outsiders tolerate it,
- orderly enough that commerce keeps flowing,
- and dangerous enough that coercion is too costly.

### Governance: the Oziri Council
Oziri is governed via an **Oziri Council**, a body composed of representatives from the most powerful factions on Oziri (often pirate lords and their aligned syndicates).

The Council coordinates:
- docking rights and lane assignment
- taxation/fees and maintenance obligations
- policing and neutral-ground enforcement
- resource stockpile management (food/water/air/industrial consumables)
- foreign policy stances (especially during corridor windows)
- space patrol contributions and defensive readiness

Council decisions are not democratic. They are negotiated power settlements.

### Law and order model
Oziri enforces stability through a mix of:
- reputation and economic incentives
- selective brutality (high certainty punishment for certain “red lines”)
- and private enforcement arms aligned with Council factions

A common Oziri pattern:
- violence is tolerated in the “right places”
- commerce is protected in designated neutral districts and lanes
- killing on protected ground triggers severe, rapid retaliation (because it threatens everyone’s business)

Oziri’s order is not moral. It is functional.

### Logistics reality
To survive, Oziri must secure:
- food, water, air processing
- medical supply chains
- replacement parts and industrial feedstocks
- technicians and labor

This is achieved through:
- trade and brokerage (legal and illegal)
- protection contracts
- selective raiding that avoids triggering total war
- and internal production in districts capable of manufacturing and recycling

Oziri looks less like a gang hideout and more like a rough port-state: markets, labor, security, and bureaucracy, all run by criminals with incentives to keep the machine running.

### Relationship to corridor windows (high-level)
During corridor windows, Oziri’s governance shifts into “truce mode”:
- more centralized lane control
- stricter neutral-ground enforcement
- aggressive counter-sabotage
- heavy emphasis on predictable, profitable operations

Outside windows, Oziri reverts to its normal pattern:
- opportunistic raiding (carefully bounded)
- factional feuds contained to non-critical zones
- commerce as the constant glue holding it together
