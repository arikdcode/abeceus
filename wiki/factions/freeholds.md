# The Freeholds

A major inner-system faction characterized by:
- **Political fragmentation** (multiple freeholds, compacts, or member polities)
- **High civic capacity** (stable institutions, training pipelines, credible defense)
- **Strategic preference for neutral leverage** over open domination

## Identity

The Freeholds are not "the Belt," and not a corporate cartel. They are a real polity with:
- Population
- Industrial base
- Military capable of defending their interests

## Strategic Role

The Freeholds act as a **third pole** in great-power maneuvering, preventing all geopolitics from collapsing into a Mesulea vs. Nuilea binary.

They are positioned to become:
- Financiers and insurers of system commerce
- Neutral arbitration venues
- A balancing weight when the gas giants escalate

## Details TBD

Culture, geography, and internal politics to be defined as the setting develops.
