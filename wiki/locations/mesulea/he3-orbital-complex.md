# Helium-3 Orbital Complex

An orbital facility in [[locations/mesulea/index|Mesulean]] space that serves as the central hub for helium-3 distribution.

## Function

Container ships from atmospheric mining stations like [[locations/mesulea/aeolus-station|Aeolus Station]] deliver refined helium-3 to the Complex. From here, helium-3 is taken to market throughout the Abeceus system.

## Operations

Launches from atmospheric stations must be scheduled precisely to:
- Make rendezvous with the Complex in orbit
- Minimize the number of launches
- Minimize the time station warehouses are full

## Strategic Importance

The Complex is a critical chokepoint in [[factions/mesulea|Mesulea's]] helium-3 monopoly. Control of this facility and its associated infrastructure gives Mesulea significant economic leverage over the entire system, particularly [[factions/nuilea|Nuilea]].
