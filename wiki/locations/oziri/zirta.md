# Zirta

The largest city on [[locations/oziri/index|Oziri]], jointly managed by the entire [[factions/oziri-council|Oziri Council]].

## The Zirta Dock

The largest dock on Oziri sits directly above the city, beneath the planetary shell. It attracts the most commercial traffic of any dock on Oziri.

### Structure
Like all Oziri docks, the Zirta Dock is structured in a **honeycomb pattern**:
- Each cell houses a single ship
- Retractable doors on each cell (usually open during peacetime)
- Different sized cells for different craft

## City Layout

The city exists in a **colossal chamber** beneath the docks:
