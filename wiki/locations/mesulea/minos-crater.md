# Minos Crater

A massive crater on [[locations/mesulea/miezo|Miezo]] (Mesulea's capital moon), famous for being **operationally unreadable** at distance.

## Why Observation Fails

- **Atmospheric isolation**: Rim traps a dense, stratified gas layer
- **Chemical opacity**: Suspended particulates scatter sensor bands
- **Electromagnetic noise**: Ionization degrades radar and lidar
- **Corrosive environment**: Probes suffer rapid surface degradation

You can map the crater shape, but not determine what's happening inside in real time.

## Environmental Character

- Thick, cold, chemically aggressive air
- Visibility collapses quickly with depth
- Metal "sweats," polymers degrade without shielding
- Sound behaves strangely: distant machinery carries like a low moan

Survivable only with **specialized suits** and strict time limits.

## The Rumored Facility

Intelligence circles believe Minos hosts a **Mesulean black-site** run by a compartmented "dark bureaucracy":

- Prisoner experiments and human trials
- Extreme-environment physiology work
- Interrogation and "black handling"
- Weapons/biological research

The tone is bureaucratic rather than theatrical: bland names, numbered annexes, routine paperwork. Evil expressed as process discipline and compartmentalization.

## Accessibility

Minos is not impossible to enter—just an ordeal:
- Specialized suits, corrosion-resistant seals
- Short-range inertial navigation when sensors fail
- Low-visibility descent or rim traversal
- Timed windows when atmospheric activity calms
