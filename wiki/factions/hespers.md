# The Hespers

Human polities from a nearby star system (the "Hesper System") that possess limited, operational **wormhole transit** capability.

From the Abeceus perspective, "the Hespers" are not a single unified nation—multiple factions exist—but they present as **foreign traders who arrive, trade, and leave** on a schedule dictated by the [[projects/oziri-corridor|corridor window]].

## What Abeceans Know

### Known
- The Hespers can open a wormhole corridor into Abeceus space
- The corridor is time-limited ("the window") and unstable
- Hespen expeditions are disciplined: arrive, trade rapidly, depart

### Unclear
- Whether their wormhole tech is wholly theirs or depends on older infrastructure
- Whether corridor timing is technological, astronomical, or constrained by unknown physics
- The extent of Hespen political fragmentation

## Why They Don't Conquer

1. **Limited projection**: Corridor windows restrict sustained fleet movement
2. **Cost and risk**: Operating at corridor's end is dangerous and expensive
3. **Human familiarity**: They view Abeceus as a trade partner, not an easy prize

## Technology Control

Hespen governments enforce strict controls:
- Wormhole/transit technology is **not for sale**
- Export controls preserve their comparative advantage
- This creates stable, enduring tension

## What They Buy

- **Helium-3** (high energy-density fuel feedstock)
- Specialty industrial goods, materials, and biologicals

Hespen willingness to pay premium prices makes corridor windows economically explosive.

## Abecean Attitudes

- Governments: Strategic shock—new market, benchmark, destabilizer
- Corporations: Once-in-a-lifetime customer
- Oziri: Profit engine worth protecting
